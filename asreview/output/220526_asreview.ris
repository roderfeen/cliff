AB  - For several decades, philanthropists in the United States have played a behind-the-scenes role in framing climate change as a social problem. These foundations have defined climate change primarily as a pollution problem solvable by enacting a price on carbon and by shifting markets in the direction of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency practices. Funding has favored “insider” groups that push for policy action by way of negotiation, coalition building, and compromise, rather than “outsider” groups that specialize in grassroots organizing. Philanthropists have also placed less priority on funding for other low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, or natural gas, nor have they invested in actions intended to boost societal resilience, protect public health, or to address questions of equity and justice. But in the years following the failure of the 2010 Federal cap and trade bill, a review of available grants from 19 major foundations indicates that philanthropists responded to calls for new directions. Funding shifted to focus on state- or municipal-level mitigation and adaptation actions and to the needs of low-income/minority communities. Significant funding was also devoted to mobilizing public opinion and to opposing the fossil fuel industry. Nearly a quarter of all funding, however, remained dedicated to promoting renewable energy and efficiency-related actions with comparatively little funding devoted to other low-carbon energy technologies. The review of past funding trends provides implications for assessing philanthropic strategy during the Donald J. Trump presidency and beyond.

AB  - Managing the process of electricity generation appears to be the important dimension of the evaluation of comparative advantages for promising sources of energy. Solar and wind energy have signifi cant characteristics, which provide an opportunity to explore particular forms of organization and management to operate effi ciently and increase benefi ts of renewables use. In the article the focus has been placed on the forms of organization, enabling the spread of renewable energy at the global scale, i.e. diver-sifi cation and decentralization, networks including the participation of philanthropists and NGOs in the innovation sphere and international partnerships in the fi eld of ecology and climate change. New practices are evaluated in the context of Siberia, which seems to be a demonstrative socio-economic megaregion, where fossil fuels are extracted in a great amount and projects on renewable resources are carried out. It is shown that economic potential of new approaches to renewables has been rather underestimated, and the prerequisites for the changes have been depicted, i.e. diversifi cation, philanthropic activity, elimination of technological lock-in of perspective technologies of renewables and invigorating the performance of NGOs in global initiatives. © 2020 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

AB  - In mobilizing funds that selectively support non-profits, foundations shape the political field. This study maps the funding relationships between foundations, ENGOs and think tanks in Canada and considers the implications for environmental politics. We examine foundation funding for different strains of environmental politics and policy-planning and consider how ENGOs and think tanks are clustered as communities within a foundation-centred support network. Of particular interest are ‘clean growth’ ENGOs that have emerged as key proponents of business-friendly approaches to the climate crisis. We find that the ENGOs receiving large grants tend to be conservationist while the think tanks tend to be conservative. Communities in the network are divided between several clusters of corporate and family foundations supporting conservative think tanks, clean growth ENGOs and conservationist ENGOs, and a segment of the network in which one municipal and several family foundations, support more social-ecological organizations, thereby facilitating more transformative visions and policies. Although few in number, clean growth organizations tend to receive giant donations, in some cases from corporate foundations aligned with the fossil-fuel sector. Recent adoption of clean growth as governmental policy and its embrace within philanthropic missions could reshape the environmental field towards ‘clean growth’, as ENGOs seek funding and legitimacy. © 2021 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie

We began with a request, in fall of 2018, to Revenue Canada for data on the 100 largest foundations in Canada (ranked by the total amounts of their gifts) and the 100 largest foundations (ranked by assets) – a total of 140 foundations, given the overlap between these lists. As part of the same request, we included eight additional foundations that a panel of knowledgeable researchers identified as being of interest to this research. The resulting data contained 18,346 records of donations in the donors’ 2017 fiscal year totalling CAN $1.377 billion, with a mean of $75,070 and a median of $5128. Each record indicated the donor, donee and amount given (as well as other attributes such as city of head office).', 'Funding text\xa02:\xa0The key exceptions to this pattern are themselves illuminating. Several social-ecological ENGOs receive funds from business-aligned foundations; however, these ENGOs do not pursue projects in tension with capital’s growth imperatives within Canada. The Weston Foundation funds both the Fraser Institute and Seed Change, a church-based project whose remit is primarily international (founded in 1945, this ENGO supports agro-ecological development internationally). The Calgary Foundation funds the Calgary-based All One Sky Foundation, whose social-ecological environmentalism focuses on building resilient communities in Alberta that will be able to cope with climate change (its website avoids any mention of the causes of climate change). The two bank-based foundations mostly fund conservation groups, but TD Friends of the Environment also supports Ecosource Mississauga, which promotes community gardening and other urban green initiatives that do not pose obvious challenges to business-as-usual. Halifax-based Ecology Action Centre, committed to ‘biodiversity protection, climate change and environmental justice’,11 is the only social-ecological ENGO receiving major funding from a foundation that also funds conservative think tanks (namely, the Donner Foundation).', 'Funding text\xa03:\xa0Within the network, the conservationist strain predominates. Fully 43 of the donees are of this type; 25 are social-ecological ENGOs; nine are clean growth ENGOs; 11 are think tanks; six are hubs. What makes this collection of organizations a connected network are the overlapping social circles of donors and donees. On one side of the relationship, several centrally positioned foundations make major donations to overlapping sets of ENGOs and think tanks (in decreasing order of centrality, Echo, RBC, Ivey, Schad, Sitka, Vancouver, Aurea, Weston, Suncor, Donnor, TD Friends). On the other side, the social circles of donees also overlap, as many of them receive donations from the same foundations. For instance, Tides (located at the centre) receives major funding from all of the six most central donors and from seven less central foundations. The Nature Conservancy (bottom centre) is funded by five of the relatively central donors and five less central ones. The social circles of Tides and Nature Conservancy overlap substantially, as both receive major donations from Echo, Schad, Sitka and the Vancouver Foundation.']

AB  - In this chapter from their new book, Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet, the founder of Bloomberg LP and former mayor of New York City collaborates with the former executive director of the Sierra Club in showing how the pursuit of profit by companies and their investors is playing an important role in the battle against global warming. Climate change is shown as posing a series of discrete, manageable challenges-such as accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy-that have spurred a search for solutions that promise to make our society healthier and stronger. National governments, the authors argue, are not the best places to create or carry out these solutions. Rather, it is the mayors, CEOs, entrepreneurs, activists, concerned citizens, and other local actors who have the strongest incentives as well as the power and means to win the battle against climate change-and in ways that have already begun to generate economic growth and improve public health. State governors and mayors of cities around the U.S., in red and blue states alike, have been responsible for much of this progress. Cities and states have negotiated contracts with local utilities to provide greater amounts of clean energy, and used combinations of public and private capital to fund rapid transit, waste-water treatment, and other infrastructure programs. But an equally important if not larger role is now being played by business. Companies large and small, with the backing of a growing number of environmentally conscious but resolutely profit-seeking investors, are finding ways to reduce waste and strengthen worker protection and morale throughout supply chains that are providing increasingly climatefriendly products and services. The authors' bottom line, then, is that preventing climate change will require more than goodwill and government regulation. It will take the profit motive, a force that that many environmentalists have long viewed with suspicion. While acknowledging the past efforts of socially responsible investment funds that have shown a willingness to sacrifice returns, the authors conclude that the enlightened self-interest of value-seeking investors may well prove more effective than the "beneficence" of social investors and philanthropists in producing investments of sufficient scale and practical efficacy to meet the challenges of global warming.

AB  - Although wealth inequality has many established negatives, this study investigates a potential positive, unprecedented wealth concentration makes it possible for solutions to large and seemingly intractable problems to be deployed by convincing a relatively small number of individuals to invest. In order to probe this potential outcome of inequality, this study quantifies the number of people necessary to radically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global climate destabilization from the U.S. electric grid, which is one of the largest sources of emissions. Specifically, this study determined that 1544 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology must be deployed to eliminate the use of fossil fuels on the U.S. electric grid, if PV is conservatively deployed as a function of population density. The results showed that only 79 American multi-billionaires would need to invest in PV. This investment would still leave each investor with a billion dollars of liquid assets as well as substantial long-term profits from PV. The analysis also concluded that 79 people is a conservative upper estimate of those that would need to be convinced of the usefulness of moving to a solar U.S. grid and that this estimate is likely to decrease further in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The movement for divestment from fossil fuels is building momentum, and pension funds, municipalities, and universities around the world are increasingly being pressured to eliminate their holdings in fossil fuel stocks in order to fight climate change. While the debate over whether divestment is in line with fiduciary duty continues, there is some consensus that divestment, in theory, is consistent with meeting fiduciary duty. Yet, in practice, institutions fear divesting due to a lack of clear law on the issue and fiduciary standards that discourage departure from the status quo. The relatively new movement has largely avoided the courts up to this point. However, in November 2014, a group of Harvard students paved the way with a lawsuit against Harvard alleging claims of (1) "mismanagement of charitable funds" and (2) "intentional investment in abnormally dangerous activities" for failing to divest from fossil fuel stocks. Previous literature on the subject has focused on legislative and regulatory solutions rather than looking at possible legal claims that could compel divestment under current laws. The Harvard suit suggests, however, that there is a role for courts to play; litigation might be the only viable solution as legislative and regulatory attempts are moving too slowly and ineffectively to deal with the pressing nature of climate change. This Note argues that courts should recognize the special threat posed by climate change to humanity as well as to portfolio risks and returns, take an expansive view of the special duties charitable institutions and public entities owe, and require charitable and public institutions to take into account the effects of climate change when making investment decisions.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) require sustained funding to provide sustained marine protection. Up until now government budgets, multi- and bi-lateral aid, and philanthropic grants have been commonly relied upon to finance the management and enforcement of MPAs. But new funding mechanisms, such as impact investments or blue carbon, are increasingly applied and developed. Here, we present a semi-structured review that identifies 11 or more sources of finance, 21 financial instruments and more than 75 potential combinations thereof that show the current diversity of financial mechanisms available to support MPA establishment and operations. Based on the review, we developed nearly 100 indicators reflecting environmental, governmental, socioeconomic, and management characteristics that can inform the appropriateness, and corresponding strengths and weaknesses, of applying these financial mechanisms to any given MPA. The outputs provide a series of recommendations for implementing new funding mechanisms and ways to improve the sustainability of in-place mechanisms. The findings were compiled into a replicable framework and excel tool that was pilot tested in May 2021 for Parque Nacional Natural Corales de Profundidad in Colombia that identified potential ways to improve upon financial mechanisms, including, hiring a full-time manager and potential alternative mechanisms like biodiversity offsets from fossil fuel exploration and exploitation, among several others. The research also identified barriers for implementing financial mechanisms that reflect broader systemic challenges for MPA finance worldwide.

AB  - Wellcome exists to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive. We are a global charitable foundation, both politically and financially independent. We support scientists and researchers take on big problems, fuel imaginations and spark debate. The health of the global population and the planet are inextricably linked but there is a poor ecological fit between what we are asking of the planet and its resilience. If the complex natural systems we rely on for clean air, fresh water, fertile soil, biodiversity and a stable climate are threatened, so too is our health. The challenge is to secure the health and well-being of present and future generations whilst responsibly stewarding the planet. As research continues to unravel our understanding of the vital links between health and the environment, we become better equipped to develop robust, coherent and coordinated solutions that jointly reduce threats to human health and to the surrounding environment that sustains it. There are already clear opportunities for change but more research is needed. Our Planet, Our Health was identified as new priority area for Wellcome in 2015. We support work that embraces and stimulates creative partnerships, collaborating across disciplines and sectors, because we believe that we need a diversity of competencies to tackle these complex problems. Our aim is to gain deeper insights into these issues, to inform the global response through transdisciplinary research and develop policies that will help mitigate the risks to human health. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - This book explores how a handful of liberal foundations contributed to establish and orientate the international climate regime. Looking back at the origins of international climate philanthropy and its evolution over the past three decades, the author examines the role of philanthropic foundations in the international climate debate. The research presented in this book shows that foundations, through their grant-making and convening activities, are at the heart of the climate debate. In fact, many credit them with having, through their activities prior to and at the COP, significantly contributed to laying the basis for the Paris Agreement in December 2015. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Philanthropic foundations are a mainstay of the international climate debate, and yet they are surprisingly absent from the mainstream academic literature. This article attempts to fill this gap by exploring how philanthropic foundations, through their grantmaking, field-building and convening efforts, sought to shape and orientate the international climate regime. In particular, we show how foundations have historically worked to incorporate US positions into the international climate process. While the foundations and strategies have changed over time, foundations have unfailingly worked to bridge the divide between the US and the international climate policy field. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Alongside the climate change denial movement, a section of the capitalist class has been organizing to promote a project of “climate capitalism” that relies on carbon markets and other policies compatible with the neoliberal order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Like the denial movement, promoters of climate capitalism have constructed an extensive network of think tanks and policy-planning groups to foster adherence to their climate policy proposals. This article uses social network analysis to map out the reach of these climate and environmental policy groups within the array of interconnected NGOs, inter-governmental organizations, philanthropic foundations, and other organizations that constitute the global polity. This analysis sheds light on the position climate capitalism—understood as a project of a section of the global corporate elite—occupies among international organizations. Overall, I find that climate and environmental policy groups: (1) maintain substantial ties to key organizations of the global polity, and (2) mediate a substantial amount of relations, bridging between central organizations and more peripheral ones, as well as among those located in Europe and North America. I thus argue that a global inter-organizational infrastructure exists that supports climate capitalism, which contributes to its dominant position in climate change politics. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Foundations in Germany were examined in the context of environmental issues. Data from environmental foundations show that there is huge difference between private and public foundations concerning financial settings. Furthermore, environment is often not the only objective and sometimes not even processed. Our analysis shows that there are different types of foundations with regard to environmental scopes and activities. Although “attractive topics” such as biodiversity and landscape conservation seem to be more important to foundations, less visible topics such as pollution prevention remain merely a “blind spot.” Together, these findings suggest that there is only a limited potential of private foundations compared with public foundations. Nevertheless, there might be an impact on environmental awareness and local sustainability. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - In the face of decreasing returns on investments and the growing influence of sustainability requirements, foundations have had to adjust the way they invest their assets. Sustainable investments have shown themselves to be as robust in terms of their returns as conventional investments and—more than that—they can support foundations’ goals much more effectively. But only very few foundations implement sustainable investment strategies. The present study analyses the reasons for this, by means of interviews with personnel responsible for assets. The interviewees operate as ‘sense givers’ who have to kickstart a process of strategic readjustment. The reference framework for their ways of thinking and acting has been investigated using framing analysis. So-called sense givers’ isolated position in their foundations is the rather disturbing finding of this study. Familiar strategies of action seem to be of little help in their endeavours. This is frequently expressed in sometimes poignant calls for external guidelines and role models, while specific ideas about courses of action remain relatively vague. This applies particularly to large foundations where strategic readjustments are hindered by complex structures and hierarchies, whereas in small‐scale entities, decisions follow shorter, face‐to‐face pathways. The imperative of carving out a complex sustainability discourse in their foundations drives sense givers to activities like networking inside and outside their foundations in order to exchange ideas and build alliances, for example within the German Association of Charitable Foundations. Investment managers need first of all to develop new strategies to convince the range of stakeholders in their foundations. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - • The United Nations 2030 Agenda creates an opportunity for philanthropic foundations to become more collaborative and transformative in their work toward global goals. Thus, since 2016, the extent to which foundations adopt the Sustainable Development Goals framework in their functioning has become a topic of interest. Although survey- and case-based research shows increased rates of self-reported adoption and several tools are available to help foundations to act toward the goals, there is a lack of systematic evidence about the purposes of and processes for adopting the goals among foundations. • This void is particularly relevant for community foundations, as they have been proposed as natural champions for the 2030 Agenda. This article provides global and national context to the process of adoption of the goals by Canadian community foundations through a multiple case study, tracing it back to its origins and disentangling its antecedents, enablers, and effects during the early implementation phase. Special attention is paid to the roles played by collective action by Community Foundations of Canada, by grassroots actors, and by innovative practices in that process of adoption. • Conclusions point toward bottom-up social innovation originating in grassroots work that is diffused horizontally by Community Foundations of Canada to its member foundations, as a key antecedent. Enduring collaboration dynamics involving community foundations, prior engagement with data collection and a shared measurement framework, and space for local discussion and adaptation around the framework are identified as key enablers for adoption. • Finally, early effects of adoption for mapping, reporting, and aligning purposes include reframing current work and promoting new activities and leadership roles, paving the way for new partnerships, and providing a coherent planning framework and strategic focus to grantmaking. © 2021.

AB  - Foundations (and philanthropy in general) have great political power in the United States and worldwide, yet this is hardly noted by political analysts or journalists. Their power is exerted in many ways, such as by funding progressive organizations and movements; sponsoring policy think tanks and organizations of public officials; influencing the political culture through media, academic researchers, and university programs (including public interest law in law schools); and co-opting activists and potential rebels among the rich and poor. Because of their resources and prestige, they are powerful members of coalitions and collaborations with overt and covert government departments, U.N. agencies, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. Foundations have been major actors in the Cold War, which continues as the attempt to deflect any movement towards socialism here or abroad. Globalization has amplified the power of foundations, for many of the global institutions were created by foundations and continue to be fostered by them. The sponsorship of civil society institutions worldwide by private foundations, now with additional billions from governments and international governmental institutions, supports U.S. hegemony: military, political, and economic. We cannot know what the world would have been like absent foundation activities, but the current one does not appear to have a democratic, peaceful, or sustainable future. © 2015 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.

AB  - The effects of Covid-19 are tangible around the globe with emerging and third world countries being particularly affected by the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. The author explains the impact of Covid-19 on the work of foundations and the role of the latter in addressing global challenges. Foundations that are set up in perpetuity are often deemed slow and dilatory when it comes to taking decisions. Covid-19, however, demands fast, not to say unbureaucratic action. This is often contrary to the character of foundations and the way in which many of them pursue their programmatic goals. Foundations, therefore, risk falling short of their social mission and even missing the opportunity to offer society pioneering solutions. Yet, the current crisis has also underlined the importance of strategic partnerships between foundations and other players and of involving local people in bringing about social change. This being said, by their very nature, foundations are eminently predisposed to provide sustainable relief in crises such as Covid-19 and to mitigate long-term societal impact.

KW  - ['Crowding out', 'Foundations', 'Germany', 'Legal regulation and incentives', 'Role of foundations', 'United States']
AB  - According to the relevant literature, the relationship between government and the private foundation sector in Germany is marked by a "paradigm of conflict" very similar to the one that has often dominated the U.S. discussion of government/ nonprofit relationships in the past. More specifically, scholars often hold that the development of foundations in Germany is largely hampered by an administrative and regulatory climate that weakens rather than strengthens the foundation community. Two main arguments are brought forth in this context: First, the expansion of the state bureaucracy into traditional activity fields of foundations "crowds out" the foundation sector; second, the structure of tax regulations is detrimental to a "sound" development of foundations. However, while these arguments figure prominently in the policy debate, they have neither empirically nor analytically been substantiated as of yet. Borrowing from organizational theory, this article critically evaluates the arguments in the light of available evidence in an effort to contribute to a better understanding of foundations in an international context.

AB  - Enterprise foundations are foundations, which own companies. While this structure is little known outside Northern Europe, a number of leading global companies such as Robert Bosch, Rolex, Carlsberg, Hershey, Ikea, the Wallenberg sphere or the Tata Group are ultimately owned by foundations. Aside from their economic significance, enterprise foundations have interesting governance characteristics including long-term ownership, the absence of a personal profit motive and the combination of business and philanthropy. Recently, they have attracted attention as a safeguard for a company purpose. In this monograph, we review the limited, but growing literature on the topic focusing on law, taxation, governance, and performance. We conclude by considering policy implications and avenues for research.

AB  - Though the problems facing U.S. cities are increasingly regional in nature, traditional state and market institutions set up to address these problems are often organized along counter-regional lines. In this article I ask: Given the non-regional nature of these institutions, how can planners set a regional planning agenda? After examining the counter-regional pressures placed on most institutional actors, I conclude that private foundations are in a key strategic position to set this agenda. Basic goals that policymakers and grassroots leaders articulate for improving economic, environmental, and social conditions in their regions are discussed, and I attempt to re-frame these goals in terms of a regional finding strategy for foundations. In re-framing these goals, the potential for foundations to encourage collaboration between diverse grantees is highlighted, as are various strategies that foundations can use to help their grantees achieve these goals. Utimately, the proper role for a private foundation interested in promoting regional equity and sustainability is to create a "language of regionalism" by promoting information-sharing between grantees with the most abstract vision Jbr the region (policy institutes and universities) and grantees who are working on the ground (community-based organizations).

AB  - This sophisticated article takes us back to the history and philosophy of charitable foundations. Foundations are among the oldest cultural achievements of mankind. They are known to have existed in the earliest societies of Egypt and Mesopotamia, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Given the differences between Islamic law, Anglo-Saxon law, Roman law and other legal systems, in a strictly legal sense, there seem to be few commonalities between different approaches. But, according to the author, this is hardly relevant. Despite the fact that foundations exist in a large number of legal forms and perform a very diverse set of functions, there is still a universal definition. Foundations, with their rich experience as sustainable owners, operators, grant-makers, and benevolent charities, are a potential source of ingenuity, know-how, empathy, voluntarism, and philanthropy, and may therefore indeed deliver valuable input in today's civil society-provided they make full use of these qualities and join forces with other agents.

AB  - Foundation grant making can play an important role in advancing the U.S. health agenda. However, given the scale of the health care system and the intractability of many of its problems, philanthropy must be guided by strategic thinking in pursuit of realistically achievable goals. This essay describes the grant-making process at one nationally oriented foundation as an example of how these challenges might be approached. We believe that greater clarity about this process can improve collaboration among foundations, help the public appreciate foundations' work, facilitate partnerships with grantees, and, most importantly, yield sustainable improvement in the problem being addressed.

AB  - U.S. foundations may well be guided by laudable values and visions. Legally, however, they are accountable to neither the public nor the community of groups that receive their funding, let alone the communities that those groups serve, with regard to what they fund. Given the prevailing political climate in the United States, the lack of program accountability to U.S. taxpayers and, indeed, the government may be a good thing; regrettably, international human rights norms do not appear to be at the top of either agenda. In fact, with only a minute percentage of the 68,000 registered U.S. foundations funding in this field in 2004, human rights is barely on the agenda of the philanthropic community itself. Leaving aside who is responsible for this, it suggests that there is something unusual about foundations that fund in this area: a vision, a sense of responsibility or sense of the possible, perhaps? Regardless of the motivation or inspiration, the actual grant-making process is far less agreeable than the world human rights grant makers endeavor to make possible. Those concerned with the ethics of transnational interventions can justifiably ask about the process by which funders in the United States determine what is to be funded around the world. At the most fundamental level, how ethical are funding programs that affect people with no voice in what is funded? Human rights grant makers, although even more removed from the site than the organizations they support, are no less responsible for the interventions they make possible. © Cambridge University Press 2007.

AB  - In the context of the ongoing financial crisis in U.S. professional journalism, philanthropic foundation-supported nonprofits are increasingly proposed as a solution to the under-provision of civic-oriented news production. Drawing on an analysis of the social composition of boards of directors and interviews with foundation officials and nonprofit journalists, this article examines both the civic contributions and limitations of foundation-supported nonprofit news organizations. Foundations are shown to place many nonprofits in a Catch-22 because of competing demands to achieve both economic “sustainability” and civic “impact,” ultimately creating pressures to reproduce dominant commercial media news practices or orient news primarily for small, elite audiences. Further, media organizations dependent on foundation project-based funding risk being captured by foundation agendas and thus less able to investigate the issues they deem most important. Reforms encouraging more long-term, no-strings-attached funding by foundations, along with development of small donor and public funding, could help nonprofits overcome their current limitations. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The US climate movement has failed to create the political support needed to pass significant climate policy. It is time to reassess climate advocacy. To develop a strategy for philanthropy to strengthen climate engagement, I interviewed over 40 climate advocates,more than a dozen representatives from the foundation community, and a dozen academics. My assessment led me to conclude that climate advocates have focused too narrowly on specific policy goals and insufficiently on influencing the larger political landscape. I suggest four ways to improve climate advocacy: 1) Increase focus on medium and longer-term goals; 2) Start with people and not carbon; 3) Focus more on values and less on science; and 4) Evaluate what works and share what we learn. To accomplish these strategies, social scientists and advocates must work together to build a culture of learning. Meanwhile, philanthropy must empower experimentation and incentivize knowledge sharing. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are a universal call for action to protect the planet, end poverty and inequality in the world. Government and philanthropy resources are not sufficient to achieve these goals and financial resources from capital markets must be directed to them. Impact investments are "investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return" and can act as a catalyzer to canalize the needed capital to achieve SDG targets by 2030. This paper investigates this emerging financial paradigm, impact investment. History of impact investment and how it differs from socially responsible investment is presented. Several countries have taken initiatives to develop a regulatory framework to support social enterprise financing. Major actors in the impact investment market are private investors, institutional investors, private foundations, banks, development finance institutions, and nongovernmental organizations. Innovative financial structures are developed among these actors along the risk-return spectrum. Impact investing will thrive if ecosystem actors work against the barriers and use the opportunities well. More academic research and training programs are needed to contribute to the development of the impact investment field.

AB  - Interest and activity around impact investment have increased significantly in recent years as businesses, governments and communities seek new solutions to enable an inclusive and sustainable society in the face of social and environmental challenges. Philanthropists, charitable foundations and institutional investors have been among the early adopters in implementing impact investment strategies and developing the field. Despite the initial enthusiasm for impact investment, many investors raise concerns as they begin to explore the practicalities of impact investing. This paper responds to these concerns by providing empirical insights on how leading institutional investors and charitable foundations have begun to develop impact investment strategies and overcome various trepidations. The findings reveal four main themes: a focus on financial-first investments; the importance of using established due-diligence processes; the opportunity to align mission and values; and, the value of networks and collaboration. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Private sector action provides one of the most promising opportunities to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time while governments move slowly or even oppose climate mitigation. Starting with the insight that much of the resistance to climate mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government, this books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to demonstrate how private initiatives are already bypassing government inaction in the US and around the globe. It makes a persuasive case that private governance can reduce global carbon emissions by a billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining an examination of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade, a theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and a review of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars, business and advocacy group managers, philanthropists, policymakers, and anyone interested in climate change. © Michael P.

AB  - Being a key part of the investment process, sustainability issues are not only limited to individual investment transactions, but also to institutional investment process. This chapter illustrates how sustainable investment can be integrated systematically into the institutional investment process. This chapter also focuses on the investment processes applied by pension funds, insurance companies, major charitable foundations and family offices. Moreover, it is always useful to call on the help of experts when making decisions on how to design and implement an investment strategy that includes sustainability criteria. Subsequently, investment beliefs, normative principles, legal framework, risk capacity of the institution, and risk orientation of the board of trustees all determine the investment strategy-that is, how best to achieve the investment objectives. Therefore, it can be concluded that sustainability is an integral part of the investment process and does not only relate to the selection of individual investments. The institutional investors wishing to implement sustainable investment strategies themselves must have the necessary staff and resources. Although, primary sustainability analyses can be obtained from numerous independent providers, they must be evaluated and integrated in the context of a given portfolio. A sustainable investment approach complements conventional risk management methods and may help to avoid certain extra-financial risks, such as reputational risks or risks stemming from climate change. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Singapore Pte.

AB  - Sustainable investment strategies include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects alongside economic considerations. In line with Eurosif, the European Sustainable Investment Forum, this chapter describes the distinction between core and broad strategies wherein, core investment strategies are those that consist of screening strategies that systematically impact portfolio construction. They often imply a values-based approach. On the other hand, broad investment strategies tend to be adopted by mainstream institutional investors and include the integration of ESG issues in the investment process. Another classification approach differentiates between active strategies, which are aimed at achieving change, and passive strategies, which are passive and rely on the implementation of pre-determined criteria and rules. Generally, engaged investors combine strategies to achieve their goal of setting sustainability standards while achieving target returns and optimizing the risk profile. In practice, various investment strategies associated with sustainability usually complement rather than exclude each other. Sustainable thinking lies at the heart of charitable institutions and foundations in particular. Increasingly, foundations are following a mission-related investment approach in order to align their investments with their charitable objectives. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is a global problem requiring a collective response. Grassroots advocacy has been an important element in propelling this collective response, often through the mechanism of campaigns. However, it is not clear whether the climate change campaigns organized by the environmental advocacy groups are successful in achieving their goals, nor the degree to which other benefits may accrue to groups who run them. To investigate this further, we report a case study of the Australian climate change advocacy sector. Three methods were used to gather data to inform this case study: content analysis of climate change organizations' websites, analysis of website text relating to campaign outcomes, and interviews with climate change campaigners. Findings demonstrate that climate change advocacy is diverse and achieving substantial successes such as the development of climate change-related legislation and divestment commitments from a range of organizations. The data also highlights additional benefits of campaigning such as gaining access to political power and increasing groups' financial and volunteer resources. The successful outcomes of campaigns were influenced by the ability of groups to sustain strong personal support networks, use skills and resources available across the wider environmental advocacy network, and form consensus around shared strategic values. Communicating the successes of climate change advocacy could help mobilize collective action to address climate change. As such, this case study of the Australian climate change movement is relevant for both academics focusing on social movements and collective action and advocacy-focused practitioners, philanthropists, and non-governmental organizations. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.

AB  - • Drawing on case studies in Canada, this article analyzes the critical role that community indicators can play in philanthropy's ability to localize the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals to address complex societal and environmental challenges. • Measurement is an integral component of Agenda 2030, and communities are increasingly using indicators to align their plans, inform granting decisions, and track equity and sustainability outcomes. Canada's most extensive community-driven indicator program, Vital Signs, uses different types of data to measure the vitality of a community and support action toward improving collective quality of life; and data gathered through the program is used to support evidence-based, locally relevant philanthropy. This article highlights case studies from three community foundations in Canada that have successfully localized the 2030 Agenda by aligning their Vital Signs data and associated programming with the SDGs to coordinate community action. • This article details the technical challenge of localizing the SDGs through community indicators and demonstrates how the localization process itself can help foundations achieve desired outcomes and drive progress at the community level. Altogether, community indicator initiatives like those used in Vital Signs research are useful tools to help philanthropic organizations accelerate community-level SDG implementation and tackle complex, intersecting challenges related to sustainability, equity, and justice. In turn, a data-driven approach to localizing the SDGs can strengthen the philanthropic sector's ability to target its impact on the issue areas and populations that need it most. © 2021. Dorothy A.

AB  - This chapter applies a human rights theory of global justice to the problem of climate change and climate justice. Climate change poses a severe threat to our planet, to human rights and to global justice. But it is hard to speak generally about the global justice implications of climate change because its effects - particularly its human rights effects - vary by context. In some places there will be more drought. In others, there will be more floods or more severe storms or storms coming at times when agriculture could be damaged. Some people will be exposed to more severe heat and for longer days, making their energy needs greater. India is expected to experience many of these climate change threats. Can a theory of human rights guide a theory and practice of global justice and responsibility relevant to the varied context of climate change injustice? The chapter applies a human rights theory of global justice to the problem of climate change and offers five guidelines for approaching climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, programmes, philanthropy and government aid. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Bijayalaxmi Nanda and Nupur Ray.

AB  - Environmental campaigns to save the Great Bear Rainforest (GBR) in British Columbia, Canada faced complex ecological, socio-economic, and political challenges that made traditional models of protected areas unfeasible. Between 2001 and 2007, the Government of British Columbia announced commitments to a series of conservancies, to "government-to-government" negotiations with First Nations, and to ecosystem-based management and sustainable development in the remaining region, supported by a $120 million Conservation Opportunities Fund (COF). This innovative policy solution developed out of complex negotiations between ENGOs, industry, First Nations, local communities, and the province. American charitable foundations funded the campaigns of environmental nonprofit organizations (ENGOs) and contributed substantial amounts to the conservation-financing fund. While their role is frequently noted, it has not been adequately studied. Engaging the scholarly and professional conversations about the neoliberal underpinnings of philanthrocapitalism or venture philanthropy, I argue that the lens of governmentality - the techniques and rationalities of governance that produce and normalize patterns of thought and behavior - draws attention to discursive as well as financial circulations, to agonistic relations and negotiations, and to processes of inclusion and exclusion. I then trace the circulation of financial resources and discursive representations between foundations and ENGOs between 1997 and 2007. Given concerns that neoliberal philanthropy may narrow ENGO campaigns and conservation solutions to those most amenable to market relations and may institutionalize neoliberal rationalities within recipient organizations, this paper raises crucial questions about the growing adherence to philanthrocapitalism within the foundations involved and the formation, articulation, and inclusion/exclusion of ENGO voices in the process of negotiating the made-in-BC solution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, the “arduous” application processes required investment of significant executive and staff resources with no guarantee of securing funds and with the risk of being redirected from their own program priorities to those of the grantors ( Brest, 2003: 50–51 ). These negotiations created pressure not just to succeed in funding applications but, more importantly, to succeed in building strong relationships with foundations’ program officers and thereby shape funders’ conservation goals and strategies. ENGOs can therefore be understood as dual advocats: on one hand, they aim to influence specific policies to be formalized by the BC government ( Cashore et al., 2001 ); on the other, they have to influence the “policy” of foundations, as this determines grant priorities and their own viability as grant recipients. This raises the likelihood of a secondary form of policy “competition” between ENGOs, this time centered on funding networks rather than government.', 'Funding text\xa04:\xa0The emphasis on business models of operation and investment is intensified by the foundations’ emphasis on program deliverables, concrete “wins,” and quantifiable outcomes, which increasingly circulate through some ENGO program articulations and institutional practices. The foundations emphasized their intent to fund ENGO campaigns that presented crystal-clear articulations of purpose, strategy, tactics, and markers of success, on the scale of the whole region. The focus on evaluation and demonstrable outcomes can encourage organizations to analyze projects and change unsuccessful activities, but it also forecloses programs that do not present quantifiable “successes.” The features of the GBR campaigns that became associated with JSP/RSP – protected areas in a status acceptable to First Nations and a conservation fund to support sustainable development work – most directly satisfied this demand. If achieved, the campaign would offer concrete “wins” that program officers could easily explain to board members. Soon after each of the foundations highlighted their commitment to importing performance evaluation techniques from the business sector, Ecotrust Canada committed, with the support of funding from the Canadian J.W. McConnell Foundation, to undertake an extensive organizational evaluation process every two years. However, its activities remained limited, in terms of communities it worked with and its focus on conservation economies (without pursuing large-scale protection). The David Suzuki Foundation had a clear strategy in supporting the unification of First Nations to become a central actor in conservation planning and in supporting the development of sustainable marine economic development to take the pressure off forest resources. Further, it emphasized the need for a stringent EBM framework outside the proposed conservation areas (DSF, 2000). However, because it lacked a clearly defined, tangible project end-point, the success of the DSF campaign program was difficult to evaluate.']

AB  - This chapter will provide an overview of the global norm setting for supporting local action for community development, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development. Beginning with the process of local agenda-setting under Local Agenda 21 during the Earth Summit in 1992, the chapter will briefly describe the context of government-, market-, and civil society-based approaches for devolving power to local government authorities and civil society institutions to replace exclusionist administrative and fiscal practices, and overview inclusive development efforts made by civil society organizations (CSOs) and philanthropists. It will shed light on the strategies for supporting Local Agency 21 through multilateral and bilateral small grants programmes and international NGOs (INGOs) located in the formal sector. A comparative view of the formal sector initiatives and informal sector approach of community-centred initiatives will also be presented. The chapter also dwells upon the negotiating strategies, accessing mechanisms, and spending practices of the community-based programmes; especially the strategies for accessing public resources in the context of local government budgetary processes and indigenous philanthropy. The chapter will close by presenting the better spending strategies of some innovative local initiatives based on realist costing and designing for improving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Human Development Indicators (HDIs) at the local level. © 2020 Fayyaz Baqir, Nipa Banerjee and Sanni Yaya.

AB  - Global efforts to conserve biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services have shifted from a traditional emphasis on the establishment of protected areas to one that includes the design of conservation projects that deliver positive social, ecological, and economic outcomes for people and the environment. This shift is a necessary recognition that protected areas alone will be insufficient to conserve a large proportion of species globally, especially given competing pressures for land development and marine resources. However, despite clear demonstrations of the potential benefits of managing terrestrial and marine resources to produce a sustainable mix of environmental and human co-benefits, many of the most promising models remain under-funded or largely aspirational. Consequently, only 12–17% of the estimated $300–$400 billion* of investment needed annually to maintain healthy ecosystems globally currently flows to conservation finance, with most originating from limited public and philanthropic sources. Those numbers contrast with the amount of capital available to invest globally. Institutional investors and other asset managers have more than $175 trillion in assets under management that are being invested in economic activity globally. Many of these investors are increasingly demanding that environmental sustainability be used, at least partly, to guide investment decisions. As a result of this growing demand, sustainable investment funds in the United States grew by over 33% from 2014 to 2016 and now comprise about one-fifth ($9 trillion) of professionally managed assets. Substantial opportunities may, therefore, exist to direct private capital towards conservation investments, despite the marketplace for such investments being slow to develop to date. The promise of conservation investing notwithstanding, there remain important barriers and concerns about unintended or negative outcomes for people and the planet due to bad actors, redirection of public resources, perverse incentives, misaligned objectives, or poorly designed projects. In this issue, we summarize specific challenges and opportunities related to the mobilization of private capital in conservation. There is a critically important role for the development of consistent and accountable frameworks to guide project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation while also ensuring equitable and beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders. Scientists and practitioners in the social and ecological sciences, as well as law and finance fields, can shape these rapidly growing initiatives by helping to: 1. Design investable projects with meaningful conservation impacts. 2. Develop rigorous but flexible frameworks to standardize metrics and monitoring protocols, compare project and investment outcomes, and track progress towards global targets. 3. Establish safeguards, protocols, and ethics for engaging local stakeholders. 4. Create blueprints to facilitate the design of projects that allow investors to generate economic returns while ensuring positive, sustainable outcomes for the environment. 5. Reconsider existing financial vehicles and structures of investment projects to improve flexibility, performance, and salience for stakeholders. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - From a sociopolitical perspective, a crisis results from a breakdown in collective sense-making or role structure, or from the failure of followers’ belief in leadership and cultural norms (Habermas 1975, Turner 1976, O’Connor 1987, Weick 1993, Wang 2008). While climate change exhibits many of these factors, it will also entail a host of biophysical changes, such as droughts, floods and extreme events. A combination of social and biophysical understandings is therefore pertinent to the analysis of institutional responses to climate-change risks. Institutions are broadly defined in this chapter as the ‘rules of the game’ that emerge from formal and informal norms, practices and organisational structures. Some institutions with a role and function in delivering aid or cultivating relations with governments in the global South are beginning to think about how to integrate information on climate change into their projects, programmes and strategies. These institutions are increasingly confronted with managing difficult climate-related decisions under conditions of imperfect and uncertain information. In this context, this chapter aims to address unanswered questions such as how institutions are adapting in practice, whether they are adapting successfully and whether they are adapting beyond business-as-usual. Public institutions have an important role in leading action on adaptation policy, but they also face potentially difficult challenges in ensuring feedback within their networked systems (Davies 2004, 2005). This chapter builds on a study by Boyd and Osbahr (2010), which compared the features of adaptive capacity and social learning in four UK-based development organisations. This chapter focuses instead on how two networked public institutions are adapting to climate change, examining through a resilience lens whether these institutions are adapting beyond business-as-usual and how resilient their responses to climate change are. The chapter looks at two government departments, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as these traditionally play a central role in delivering development aid and security to public and civil society actors and communities in the global South. The UK has a history of international development that is linked closely to its colonial heritage (Harriss 2005). The representation of development as a Western philanthropy has evolved over time, yet remains part of the vision and mandate of many UK institutions that are engaged in and provide the delivery of financial resources, capacity and support for development assistance (Kothari 2005). These institutions are networked across hundreds of country offices across the globe. They are distinct in size, structure, history, ideology and culture, yet also have a common mandate to address climate-change risks, security and poverty and to enhance resilient development. In this chapter, I focus only on the experts at the strategic level, as this is where the responsibility for decisions about design, funding and institutional policy in particular lies. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

AB  - US-based philanthropies have long contributed to environmental conservation through non-repayable donations, but some are now beginning to embrace novel investment strategies that are profit-orientated. From the vantage points of political economy and geopolitics, this article investigates the potential ramifications of this shift in funding for large-scale marine protected areas (LMPAs), which have been widely promoted to enhance marine biodiversity and manage sustainable fisheries. Specific attention is given to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in Kiribati, where finance from US-based philanthropic foundations is intended to support the operation and management of the LMPA and eventually compensate the government for forgone revenues from fishing licences, via the creation of a trust fund. Content analysis of key documents is conducted to empirically trace the political, legal, and financial evolution of PIPA. The findings demonstrate how, in accepting finance from philanthropic foundations, the government of Kiribati gradually relinquishes its decision-making leverage over PIPA's territory and resources. Hence, it is contended that certain legal and financial provisions could act as under-acknowledged and purposive drivers of ‘ocean-control grabbing’. Results further reveal that achieving financial sustainability for the PIPA conservation trust fund has proven difficult, opening up discussions on the extent to which PIPA could be capitalised in other ways. More broadly, the paper engages with recent debates on for-profit conservation, ocean grabbing, and the blue economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Impact investing is a rapidly evolving field-depending on the type of investors asked, they will give a variety of definitions and expectations. Much of the field has derived from philanthropic roots; however, the latest developments are driven by an investment perspective. The historically assumed trade-off between financial return and social benefit is no longer a given. Astute investors realize that incorporating sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into their analysis will often enhance long-term returns. Many of these impact-oriented trends are overlooked or undervalued by traditional investors, leaving an investment opportunity for those ahead of the curve. Before discussing the financial applications to impact investing, the article provides an overview of impact investing and its two disparate evolutionary paths, along with differing return and impact expectations. Impact investing 2.0 stems from the field's investment side, and its primary characteristic is that the drivers of the impact are integrated into creating an abovemarket return, attracting all types of investors.

AB  - An increasingly important and often overlooked issue in science and technology policy is recognizing the role that philanthropies play in setting the direction of research. In an era where public and private resources for science are strained, the practices that foundations adopt to advance basic and applied research needs to be better understood. A new book, Philanthropy and the Future of Science and Technology, is a first-of-its-kind study that provides a detailed assessment of the current state of science philanthropy, surveying the landscape of contemporary philanthropic involvement in science and technology by combining theoretical insights drawn from the responsible research and innovation (RRI) framework with empirical analysis investigating an array of examples and case studies. In particular, this analysis can inform how philanthropic funders of research focused on energy systems, environmental issues, and climate change can ensure that this scholarship is well positioned to have societal impact. Such philanthropic-supported research is needed to guide the design, development, and implementation of more effective, practical solutions and practices at multiple levels of decision-making. In doing so, this article details some of the new programmatic efforts focused on advancing energy and climate research that has emerged from the philanthropic community in recent years. This article concludes by exploring alternative future scenarios that highlight different ways in which the relationship between science philanthropy and societal responsibility might evolve going forward.

AB  - The need to tackle climate change through both mitigation and adaptation is increasingly urgent with all nations and all sectors of society needing to respond. Given this state of affairs social action is important not only to raise awareness but to stimulate appropriate responses to the climate crisis. As a consequence, social action programmes in schools have been a crucial part of learning about climate change as they provide political and practical engagement. This paper explores the experience of the Manchester Environmental Education Network (MEEN), a small UK charity that runs a social action project with schools focusing on the facilitation of inter-generational activities around climate change. Presenting three vignettes, written by myself as the MEEN coordinator, the aim is to examine the Carbon Classroom programme and discuss the ethical value of these intergenerational interactions. Rather than working with the idea of responsibility, which focuses on duty and accountability, this paper will explore climate change education through the notion of response-ability (Haraway 2016) with the aim of cultivating an ethical and open approach where responses are mutually engaging. Thus, by drawing on Barad’s theory of agential realism, the vignettes will highlight instances where enactments of response-ability occur. The conclusion will discuss the recent rise in young people engaging in activism on climate change, such as the Fridays for Future, Youth4Climate and the Extinction Rebellion movements, and question, in the light of these events, how the role of climate change educators need to be reconfigured to become more response-able. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A recent article by Sol Benatar calls on the global health community to reassess its approach to twin crises of global poverty and climate change. I build on his article by challenging mainstream narratives that claim satisfactory progress in efforts to reduce poverty and improve health for all, and arguing that any eradication of poverty that is consistent with environmental sustainability will require a more explicit emphasis on the redistribution of power and wealth. I suggest that the global health community has been largely socialised into accepting that progress and future solutions can be attained through more neoliberal development, technological advancement and philanthropic endeavour and that a more critical global health is required. I propose three steps that the global health community should take: first, create more space for the social, political and political sciences within global health; second, be more prepared to act politically and challenge power; and third, do more to bridge the global-local divide in recognition of the fact that progressive change requires mobilisation from the bottom-up in conjunction with top-down policy and legislative change. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - In September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly as the cardinal agenda for guiding future global development. In financing the SDGs, there has been an increasing call on stakeholder diversification by leveraging on other non-state actors and private finance including philanthropic institutions in influencing, delivering and advancing the SDGs. Drawing on insights from the Ghanaian philanthropic sector, I show that philanthropic institutions play complementary roles in service delivery, support civil society organisations to engage in active action and advocacy, and enhance paradigm shifts in development thinking around the SDGs. I argue for the need in embracing complexity thinking that recognises that the attainment of the SDGs is dependent on the creation of an enabling environment and effective multi-stakeholder consultation. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is marked by the consolidation of sustainability as a key guiding principle and an emphasis on cities as a potential solution to global development problems. However, in the absence of an agreement on how to implement sustainable development in cities, a set of urban policy solutions and ‘best practices’ became the vehicles through which the sustainable development agenda is spreading worldwide. This article shows that the rapid circulation of Bogotá as a model of sustainable transport since the 2000s reflects an increasing focus of the international development apparatus on urban policy solutions as an arena to achieve global development impacts, what I call the ‘leveraging cities’ logic in this article. This logic emerges at a particular historical conjuncture characterised by: (1) the rising power of global philanthropy to set development agendas; (2) the generalisation of solutionism as a strategy of action among development and philanthropic organisations; and (3) the increasing attention on cities as solutions for global development problems, particularly around sustainability and climate change. By connecting urban policy mobilities debates with development studies this article seeks to unpack the emergence, and the limits, of ‘leveraging cities’ as a proliferating global development practice. These urban policy solutions are far from being a clear framework of action. Rather, their circulation becomes a ‘quick fix’ to frame the problem of sustainable development given the unwillingness of development and philanthropic organisations to intervene in the structural factors and multiple scales that produce environmental degradation and climate change. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.

AB  - Despite extensive recommendations for adapting conservation to climate change, limited knowledge exists about how practitioners aim to respond. To address this gap, we analyzed proposals for on-the-ground climate adaptation projects submitted by US conservation non-profits, which play a central role in conserving biodiversity. We assessed 415 proposals submitted between 2011 and 2015 to the Wildlife Conservation Society's Climate Adaptation Fund, a US-based fund focused solely on adaptation for wildlife and ecosystems. We evaluated the distribution of proposed projects across conservation targets, strategies, and activities, and their geographic alignment with climate impacts. Proposals most often targeted river and riparian ecosystems, fish, and birds. Attention on amphibians and invertebrates was disproportionately low relative to their climate vulnerability. Proposals commonly included efforts to restore previous structures and functions, while relatively few described facilitating change (e.g., supporting future-adapted species). Proposal density was highest along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, geographically aligned with non-profit density and public opinion on climate change. There was no geographic alignment between exposure and proposed responses to five of six climate threats (warming, aridity, wildfire, inland flooding, sea level rise). Our findings identify gaps in adaptation attention, and can enhance strategic resource allocation, targeted capacity building, and adaptation outcomes for conservation.

AB  - Community philanthropy institutions have become increasingly popular - especially in the Global South, where they serve to harness local assets, cultivate local capacities, and build trust among diverse stakeholders. As resource extraction continues to reach into remote areas and other large-scale industries (e.g. solar energy, agroforestry) grow, pressure on resources and the rights of communities will intensify. This article presents three case studies - from Ghana, the U.S., and Canada - to examine how community philanthropy might scale up to support community-asset management and increase the power of communities to determine their own development with much greater and more complex financial investments.

KW  - ['Development', 'financialization', 'impact investing', 'Pakistan']
AB  - This article argues that impact investing is a means to promote shadow banking. This is reflected in the rise of impact investing in Pakistan, particularly its predilection for inclusive finance. Two contentions are made: one, that impact investors fill the void in enterprise finance created by regulatory constraints on banks, and two, that impact investors accommodate the demand for yield by shepherding global capital into poor countries. These contentions augment the finance and development literature which critiques the financialized development associated with the Finance for Development (FfD) agenda construed by global institutions ostensibly for the Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs, of 2015 and subsequently the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, of 2030. More recently, the narrative of slogans such as Billions to Trillions and the World Bank’s Maximizing Finance for Development agenda, have drawn criticism because they advance shadow banking. The case of Pakistan exemplifies the traction gained by impact investing as an asset class and the related imperative to measure and evaluate outcomes. The resultant focus on base-of-pyramid initiatives such as inclusive finance is thus a corollary of the financialization of development and the shifts and transformations in development initiatives that incorporate private and philanthropic or ‘patient’ capital. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The notion of blended finance has increasingly gained traction within development policy as a way to fill a series of “financing gaps” related to the Sustainable Development Goals. Recently, blended finance has received increased attention as a way to create biodiversity markets and attract private capital. Building on qualitative research on efforts to create markets for private investments in marine conservation, this paper analyses how an ensemble of non-governmental organisations, development finance institutions and philanthropists seek to fill the financing gap for marine conservation in the “Blue Economy” by using blended finance as a guiding principle. I argue that by offsetting the uncertainties related to investing in a new conservation finance space, blended finance is applied as a way to fix investors’ fictional expectations and gradually transform uncertainty in risk. In doing so, this paper contributes to the literature on for-profit biodiversity conservation by highlighting how capital's risk interpretations are constitutive of the effort to create new markets. While blended finance is applied to create new markets from below, I discuss two other possible futures that might emerge as blended finance is applied in this new frontier. On the one hand, it risks becoming a development rent that is captured by the financial sector. On the other hand, blended finance can become a technical solution that enables the maintenance of a primordial faith in market-based environmental governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

This paper conducts a systematic literature review to develop cumulative insights into impact investing in social sector organisations. It identifies four streams of impact investing research: impact investment decision making, impact evaluation in impact investing, behavioural issues in impact investing, and impact investing ecosystem. This paper also identifies nine main research focus areas within these research streams and discusses key insights into each of them. Finally, building on prior research, this article offers a comprehensive future research agenda.

AB  - Waqf (or Habous) has been recognized across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region, for several ages, as an important tool under Islamic law through which individuals and institutions create endowments or donations to be held in trust and used for social, religious, or charitable purposes. As MENA countries develop laws, policies, and instruments aimed at addressing climate change, a closer analysis of the origin and nature of the Waqf system can help frame such environmental responses and action, and could contribute further impetus to international and regional efforts to finance and implement climate action. This chapter examines the potential roles of Waqf endowments in climate change action in the MENA Region by first explaining the meaning, nature, and elements of the Waqf. It demonstrates how MENA countries can harness Islamic principles of Waqf to promote the development of environmental funds and instruments to advance climate action. Drawing from the historical civilizations and cultures of MENA countries can provide adequate solutions to the global climate change conundrum. Secondly, it situates the underlying notion of Waqfs within the comparative law of the public trust doctrine (PTD), as well as the emerging Spiritual Ecology movement (Eco-Islam). It demonstrates how scholarship on the PTD, and eco-Islam can shed light on the nature, scope, and importance of Waqfs in addressing climate change. Third, it analyzes the challenges and barriers that hamper the revival of the environmental Waqf and then suggests law and policy roadmaps for addressing such challenges. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Damilola S.

AB  - This two-part article proposes using Integral Theory as the foundation of a more sus-tainable investing practice, named here integral investing. This evolving investment concept, which crystallized over the past two decades in my personal investing practice, is a condensation of sev-eral papers presented at various finance, economics, and sustainability conferences. Part 1 sup-ports the proposal through investigations performed on 1) current investing structures, 2) global initiatives and trends, and 3) 132 leading-edge individual investors who have apparently evolved to later stages of human development. This research is revealed using Joseph Campbell's conception of the hero's journey. Based on the Integral framework, Part 2 of the article introduces a possible path toward a more sustainable investing practice that is based on evolution and the essence of all existence, considering interior as well as exterior realities. In this model, financial returns must be inseparable from a deep impact on the social, environmental, cultural, and behavioral aspects of reality as well as human development and evolution.

AB  - call the "Social Success Note". This approach may offer an innovative solution to crowd-in commercial investment at scale to organizations that seek to achieve both financial sustainability and measurable positive social and environmental outcomes. While initially designed for investment into social enterprises, this pay-for-success financing solution has application wherever there is the potential to incentivize greater positive social and environmental impact through an outcome payment linked to investment. In the Social Success Note model, a private investor agrees to make capital available to a social enterprise at a below-market rate. The investee has to repay the investment or loan, but if it achieves a predetermined social outcome, a philanthropic outcome payer provides the investor an additional "impact payment" corresponding to a market-rate return. The Social Success Note is being developed and piloted by Yunus Social Business, a global incubator of social businesses, and The Rockefeller Foundation as part of its Zero Gap portfolio, focused on developing innovative financing solutions to address the world’s most critical challenges. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This article applies various ethical frameworks to inform decision making about investment in two specific goods—strengthening public health and stabilizing the global climate. I begin by outlining how these goods traditionally competed for common and constrained resources. I then discuss how this view of competition has been rendered more problematic by emerging and compelling ethical justifications for investment in both goods based on utilitarian, Rawlsian, and communitarian analyses. I conclude by showing that these goods no longer compete head-to-head in a zero-sum way. Changes in science, technology, and society mean that investment in either good has the potential to advance both goods—that is, the goods have become synergistic. As a result, the case for investing in both is better. Copyright 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emerging narratives around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning place great faith in these technologies’ ability to ameliorate threats posed by climate change. They promise the capacity to analyze vast amounts of more precise and real-time data, improving how decision-makers predict, respond, and adapt. Yet scholars in political ecology have long observed that technocentric approaches typically reduce complex human-environment relationships in ways that fail to account for social relations and power dynamics. This paper charts the emerging political economy of “climate AI” – the philanthropies, NGOs, private consultancies, and tech giants investing in data-driven climate initiatives. Mapping out two case studies, we show that environmental and climate crises are grist for tech solutions and find that many climate AI actors are interested in it for surveillance, greenwashing, and commodifying algorithms. We pay special attention to how neocolonial and racialized power structures manifest in climate AI and outline three ways for political ecologists and digital geographers to research its socio-materiality: how computational resources are environmentally embedded, how disasters become “shocks” that the AI industry capitalizes on, and how climate AI shapes material investment flows and landscapes. Highlighting how data-driven approaches to climate crises reproduce injustices already faced by marginalized communities, our analysis contributes to research on environmental data justice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reviews social finance. Venture philanthropy, microfinance, crowdfunding and social impact bonds are financial and social innovations that reshape capital markets, the production of public goods, en- trepreneurship and the fundamental principles of financial analysis. In this context, the pursuit of social and environmental impact is assessed alongside the tradeoff between risk and expected return. The market for impact investments consists of suppliers of capital, recipients of capital, the institutional framework and financing flows. This paper describes the financial market for the pursuit of impact and highlights principal challenges, such as the small scale and long horizon of social ventures, the lack of standardized reporting and financial measures for social outcomes, as well as the elusive causality between impact investments and social change.

AB  - Everyone has an opportunity to contribute to climate solutions. To help people engage with this opportunity, it is critical to understand how climate organizations and fundraisers can best communicate with people and win their financial support. In particular, fundraisers often rely on practical skills and anecdotal beliefs at the expense of scientific knowledge. Fundraisers could be motivated to achieve a substantial boost in funding for climate solutions, if there is evidence of the financial gains that science-based fundraising makes available. In this Perspective, we provide a preliminary foray into such evidence. We bring together findings from philanthropic research and climate psychology to identify what factors can help captivate donors. Then, through an experimental study of a charitable appeal for a climate charity, we show how putting these factors into practice may contribute toward an increase in donated money. This provides optimism that evidence-based fundraising can inspire donors to contribute much-needed resources toward climate solutions. Copyright © 2022 Freeling, Dry and Connell.

AB  - More and more people and organisations who are addressing complex sustainability challenges are turning to systems change practices. They are looking to get to grips with complexity and to better understand how to use their resources, position and influence to address the challenges. These people are working across civil society, philanthropy, business, international development, government and beyond. Many hope that adopting this emerging practice will give them the answers to the long held questions of – How do I know where to intervene? How do I know that what I am doing is the ‘right’ thing? Am I using my resources for their greatest effect? Once we have set ambitious goals around issues like inequality and climate change, how do I know I am creating impact?. In 1999 Donella Meadows wrote a paper entitled Leverage points: places to intervene in a system to help translate the work of systems dynamics into understanding where a small amount of energy might have a greater effect. Ever since, practitioners have been chasing these elusive leverage points trying to understand how this might be made useful and practical. There is, however, no silver bullet to changing a system. At Forum for the Future and through the School of System Change, we work on a number of different projects such as the Protein Challenge and Boundless Roots Community as well as collaborate on, coach and co-inquire with others such as the Marine CoLAB, Oneless, Lankelly Chase Foundation. In this paper we seek to build on systems change ideas and theories, using Forum for the Future experience of working with these ideas in practice, and offer actionable knowledge (Coghlan 2007) to other change makers who are grappling with these questions. This paper provides four qualities that help us understand the dynamics of a changing system, and how potential in these dynamics might be identified and be translated into strategy and interventions. I explore and illustrate these through cases and examples and raise the question about how change makers might value what we measure when understanding impact in the context of a changing system. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper conducts an analysis of the financial resource mobilization of the organizations that make up the climate change counter-movement (CCCM) in the United States. Utilizing IRS data, total annual income is compiled for a sample of CCCM organizations (including advocacy organizations, think tanks, and trade associations). These data are coupled with IRS data on philanthropic foundation funding of these CCCM organizations contained in the Foundation Center’s data base. This results in a data sample that contains financial information for the time period 2003 to 2010 on the annual income of 91 CCCM organizations funded by 140 different foundations. An examination of these data shows that these 91 CCCM organizations have an annual income of just over $900 million, with an annual average of $64 million in identifiable foundation support. The overwhelming majority of the philanthropic support comes from conservative foundations. Additionally, there is evidence of a trend toward concealing the sources of CCCM funding through the use of donor directed philanthropies. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The level of financial support provided by private foundations and individual patrons exerts a powerful influence on the capabilities of non-profit organizations, whether conservative or progressive (Walker 1991). Private foundations gain their influence over social movement organizations through their financial power and constitute a system of power and influence. This limits the range of organizational forms and goals for movement organizations (McCarthy et al. 1991:69–70). Movement organizations depend on foundations for programmatic ideas, occasional technical support, and the sense of legitimacy and prestige that comes with foundation grants. Well-funded organizations gain the attention of policymakers simply by virtue of the recognition they have received from national grant makers (Snow 1992: 65). In addition, foundations are not passive actors, but carefully select from the grant proposals they receive. Foundations have increasingly taken a more activist role in the development of social movement organizations, including forming their own organizations (Ylvisaker 1987:363). For example, the Cato Institute was founded by the Koch Brothers, and continues to receive funding from the Koch affiliated foundations. Additionally, foundations can sometimes gain additional influence over the organizations they fund through direct participation on the board of directors (Colwell 1993: 105).']

AB  - In this article, we examine how urban resilience has emerged as a global urban policy project, offering solutions for cities about how they can adapt to and recover from shocks and stresses, particularly those associated with climate change. We conceptualize this as a multicentric global urban resilience complex, catalyzed until recently by the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities initiative in concert with the World Bank. The complex is comprised of three components: (1) a global network of foundations, multilateral agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and private-sector goods and services providers, wielding differential power and influence; (2) measurement and assessment devices that both mobilize and define resilience; and (3) initiatives to marketize urban resilience as producing a dividend also for private-sector firms and investors. Northern institutions define what should be done, downscaling this as a sequence of practices, participatory agenda setting, strategizing, and implementation to be followed by cities. Examining how the complex has come to ground in Semarang and Jakarta, Indonesia, we identify ways in which it is reproduced but also criticized and contested. If the complex in many ways is driven by philanthrocapitalist and neoliberal norms and aspirations, its programs also are subject to critique and contestations at the local scale. © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - Finance for loss and damage from human-induced climate change impacts as it is recognised in the Paris Agreement is contentiously discussed in international negotiations, so far without any resolution. Based on 43 interviews with elite stakeholders working on loss and damage (L&D), this paper explores what components a funding mechanism requires to avert, minimise and address L&D, how funds are best mobilised and how they should be administered or distributed. Interviewees included actors in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations, small island developing states (SIDS) and developing country representatives, non-governmental organisations (NGO), Executive Committee members of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), multilateral organisations, environmental actors in the private sector, and developed countries. Through analysis of responses, diverse perspectives are presented and distilled into one potential mechanism. The paper offers insights into where opinions of interviewees align or misalign and inform a way forward for L&D funding in a politically sensitive environment. The majority of interviewees believed that L&D funds should be mobilised through the ‘polluter pays principle’ to finance components of a L&D mechanism that relate to a) adaptation and disaster risk reduction, b) insurance and c) solidarity. The Green Climate Fund or the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage have the potential to play an administrative role in a L&D finance mechanism. Compensation payments are overall considered impractical, not desired by developing countries and rejected by developed nations. Unexpected responses were related to investments into gender equality to reduce L&D, establishment of sovereign funds and usage of philanthropic organisations as a funding source for L&D. © 2021 The Author

N1  - ['Export Date: 26 May 2022', 'Funding text\xa01:\xa0The history of L&D is well covered in literature ( Roberts and Huq, 2015 ) but in summary, three major milestones mark the development of L&D: i) the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) in 2013 at COP19 ( UNFCCC, 2014a; UNFCCC, 2014b ), ii) the prioritisation of L&D in the standalone Article 8 in the Paris Agreement established in 2015 at COP21 ( UNFCCC, 2015 ) and iii) the inclusion of L&D in the New and Enhanced Transparency Framework (NETF) in the Katowice Climate Package at COP24 in 2019 ( UNFCCC, 2019b ). Under section G.115 L&D can be reported on and be included in countries’ nationally determined contributions, which makes it part of the global stocktake ( UNFCCC, 2019a ). The Executive Committee (Excom) of the WIM has the mandate to work towards finding solutions to address L&D from climate change impacts. While it can be argued that actions to avert and minimise L&D (as per Article 8 of the Paris Agreement) are undertaken, addressing actual occurred L&D from climate change impacts is lacking. The WIM concluded its five-year rolling work plan and was reviewed at COP25 in 2019 but only small steps towards the identification of funding were made. This included the establishment of the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage (SN), a network for knowledge sharing and technical assistance amongst stakeholders, and the action to work with the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) to identify funds for L&D ( UNFCCC, 2020 ). The overall question of fund architecture and fund mobilisation remained unresolved and L&D does not qualify for financial assistance under any existing multilateral fund. However, with growing recognition from developed countries that L&D is occurring and the IPCC report stating that there is no doubt about the human influence to current rates of climate change ( IPCC, 2021 ), a well-functioning and agreeable funding mechanism will potentially be needed to address L&D.']

AB  - Over the past several decades large philanthropies have adopted aggressive approaches to education reform that scholars have labeled venture philanthropy. These efforts focused on broad changes to schooling and education policy, borrowing techniques from the venture capital world. But many foundations have recently become convinced that market forces and macro-level policymaking alone cannot drive educational improvement, particularly in areas related to classroom teaching and learning. In response, foundations have begun to design their own instructional innovations and identify providers to implement them. This paper interprets these recent efforts as early evidence of a distinct adaptation in the evolving role of philanthropies, which we dub design philanthropy. Although this approach represents an attempt by foundations to simultaneously increase democratic engagement, directly influence the instructional core, and spur educational innovation, it poses new risks for coherence, scalability, and sustainability in education policymaking. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this research, we present a framework for blended Islamic finance for impactful small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The blend results from discussing the pertinent perspectives that underlie the motives of philanthropy, private sector activities and public sector facilitation. The consensus of these three stakeholders on the impact criteria is an essential precondition for the blend to happen. Therefore, we first developed the consensus-based impact criteria for SMEs, namely, 4Zeros & SS (zero-waste, zero-emissions, zero-interest, zero-foreclosures and service to society). After that, we adopted a financial engineering approach to design products by blending the three motives. Financial contracts could be incentive compatible and effective if these three motivations are recognized and brought together. The purpose of our research is to offer such incentive-compatible structures that can mobilize funding for impactful SMEs, save cost as well as generate revenue for self-sustainability. In the contract design, the private sector provides finance, the philanthropist pays the costs of funds, the public sector facilitates, and the impactful SME gets subsidized financing. Since the blended nature of the contract provides a social subsidy to fund the cost element of the financing, the proposed structure creates a win-win result for the blending parties. While financial institutions expand into the SMEs sector for profitability, blended Islamic finance will attract additional resources toward enhancing development impact. Through the philanthropic component, SMEs, on the other hand, will access the source of social subsidy that will relieve the burden of the exorbitant commercial rates. The funding structure will reduce risk perception and spur growth. Consequently, this collaborative and innovative contract design will contribute to achieving multidimensional human development, as enshrined in the Maqasid al-Shariah, and the SDGs. Impactful businesses must integrate environmental, social and governance best practices as well as national development goals. Hence, the proposal offers several benefits and prospects of extended use for other consensus-based purposes such as low-cost housing, solar panelling, health, education, etc. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Based upon the existing literatures surrounding collective action and the environmental justice frame, consciousness-raising is a social tool for community constituents facing the hazards of environmental pollution to community health. Environmental pollution is a complex phenomenon that poses grand societal challenges including global implications and locally situated contexts. We believe that locally situated social problems, such as air pollution emissions, influence the functions of community philanthropy, a means of effective collective civic action. By drawing upon resource mobilization theory and organizational ecology theory, this study aims to examine the direct effects of the social problem of environmental pollution to community health and its impact on collective resource mobilization. This is accomplished by analyzing both the organizational growth of the environmental nonprofit sector in terms of the density and aggregated resources at the community level, conceptualized here as community philanthropy. Collective civic action supports environmental activism and is embodied in the shared beliefs, values, and understandings of a community whom seek a legitimate means of collective action; these opportunities are often provided by the nonprofit sector. We also examine the moderating role of community racial diversity on this relationship. Empirical results demonstrate that in racially diverse communities, community philanthropy is facilitated when facing the social problem of increased environmental pollution. Our problem-driven research implies that community racial diversity may impact the mobilization of collective resources when dealing with locally situated social problems. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to provide an example of how higher education institutions (HEIs) can use a successful campus infrastructure project to fund a student- and faculty-led, community-success platform that advances the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied conceptual models for systems thinking and creating virtuous cycles to analyze Millersville University’s work to establish a community-impact, micro-grant fund using cost savings and utility rebates associated with a new campus zero-energy building. The analysis provides a case study that other HEIs can implement to create university and community virtuous cycles that advance the SDGs. Findings: The case study suggests that as HEIs face increasing financial challenges, opportunities exist to capitalize on philanthropic giving and other funding sources to support community prosperity and increase university vitality through a shared responsibility paradigm centered on the SDGs. Practical implications: This case study identifies specific funding sources that HEIs can use to fund campus and community sustainability projects using the SDG framework, mechanisms for establishing shared purpose around that impact and a conceptual model for thinking about opportunities to leverage philanthropic giving to create a virtuous cycle that increases university vitality through community impact. Social implications: Constructing a campus zero energy building funded in part through philanthropic giving provided a unique opportunity to explore how a project’s success can be leveraged to create additional community successes. This case study offers an example for how to convert one success into a platform that funds projects that have direct community impact in one or more of the SDG goal areas. Originality/value: This paper aims at bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks for community sustainable development and descriptive-only case studies by using a case study to demonstrate a conceptual model or framework for advancing community sustainability (Karatzoglou, 2013). The case study provides a unique model for using utility rebates associated with an infrastructure project that was funded through philanthropic giving to establish a fund for projects that support the community. Utility rebates associated with campus energy efficiency projects are often otherwise overlooked, used to fund additional energy efficiency projects or simply returned to a university’s operating budget. For some HEIs, this model may connect the work of facilities staff to student success in ways that have not previously been explored. For others, this alternative use of utility rebates may offer an opportunity to increase the investment value of utility rebate dollars by creating virtuous cycles within their communities that contribute to university vitality. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As the country faces challenges in response to the current political climate, societal tragedies, and environmental disasters, citizens are besieged by nonprofit organizations requesting donations. In response to these requests, individual citizens are seeking out innovative ways to engage in philanthropy. One recent innovation in grassroots philanthropy is giving circles where individuals pool their money, knowledge, and resources to make a social impact. The functions of giving circles can be likened to collaborations in that giving circles encompass the key characteristics of collaboration including communication, consensus decision-making, focusing on common goals, a shared vision and ethical approach, pooling of resources, depending on social capital, and trust. The proposed framework of philanthropic collaboration creates an intersection between the collaboration, philanthropy, and social movement literatures by proving an innovative lens through which to view giving circles. The conceptual framework provides a tool for scholars and practitioners to define and operationalize this new innovation in grassroots philanthropy. © 2020 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become the main priority across the globe due to their significant role in economic growth and propensity. However, in particular, it is not yet known how governments can achieve SDGs through non-profit organisations (NPOs) by providing financial and non-financial incentives. The present study included 263 Pakistan NPOs in a primary survey using a questionnaire. The results obtained from the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) highlight that: (i) government incentives do not directly influence community development; (ii) The government non-financial incentives have a significant direct effect on environmental activities to reduce pollution, energy consumption and waste; (iii) Resource management fully mediates the paths between government incentives and community development while partially mediates environmental activities; and finally, (iv) resource management has a favourable influence both on the goals of community development and environmental activities. This research paper contributes to the knowledge in that government incentives do not have a direct influence on social development, but has an indirect influence through efficient management. Recommendations are that government and public bodies need to support NPOs to engage actively in philanthropic activities. Similarly, NPOs should efficiently utilize and manage the resources to benefit the maximum number of poor and needy individuals. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - A grant maker provides insight into how philanthropy can work with Arctic communities experiencing rapid change from the simultaneous impacts of climate change and globalization in the North Pacific. The focus is on the role that philanthropy can play in assisting communities in coping with changing sea ice conditions by recognizing that communities are an integral part of the social-ecological system. The role of resilience and how philanthropic organizations can increase resilience in Arctic communities and build upon their own initiatives is examined. Though private philanthropic investments are small relative to all funding in the north, they have the advantage of being nimble and are able to experiment with new ideas and novel approaches, though these efforts are not without their challenges. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - • This article outlines how strategic philanthropy can align its mission with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by describing the experience of the most important foundation of banking origin in Italy. Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo marked a milestone in 2020 in aligning with the Agenda, applying the Sustainable Development Goals as a rigorous, internationally shared methodological framework and restructuring its operations to focus on three programmatic efforts — Planet, People, and Culture — aligned with those goals. • To complete our examination of this transformation, we conducted a benchmark analysis involving nine case studies of foundations in Europe and the United States to identify the level of engagement and convergence of each with the 2030 Agenda framework. • This article begins with an introduction to the topic of sustainability in the philanthropic sector, which is followed by a case study of the Compagnia di San Paolo's path to adoption of the framework. It then measures the impact of its activities through quantitative indicators, highlighting the foundation's transformation, and concludes with a comparison between Compagnia di San Paolo's approaches and some international best practices to provide a better understanding of our long-term positioning in the international context. © 2021.

AB  - Looking at the current plight of some emerging market countries, the economic boom they experience brings with it challenges such as massive urban migration, unemployment, and environmental degradation. Given this scenario, how ready and willing are citizens and non-governmental organizations, including philanthropic foundations, to ensure balanced, sustainable growth and better lives in Turkey? How much will the Turkish government allow, and perhaps even incentivize, these contributions? What role might the private sector play, and how will it engage with NGOs in the process?

AB  - Education is a vital tool for national growth and development. Higher education institutions provide the nation with skilled manpower needed to attain holistic development. Despite the roles played by higher education institutions in nation building, these institutions are at the edge of collapse as a result of poor funding. Government fund is not adequate to meet needs of students and higher education institutions. Several options like internal sources, government supports, use of tuition fees and a host of others have been provided but all yield little result. In order to find a lasting solution to the persisting financial problem facing higher education in the country, this paper presents the Islamic finance products as an alternative measure to sustainable higher education financing in Nigeria. It adopted a qualitative case study approach. Interview was conducted on eight experts including shariah experts, lecturers and educational administrators. At the end, the research study proposed that sukuk (bond), waqf (endowment) and zakat (charity) should be used for providing facilities and support to higher education institutions in the area of research, provision of educational facilities, building of hostels for indigent students, payment of salary, provision of scholarship to students from poor background and a host of others. To achieve these, government, policy planners and leaders in higher education institutions in Nigeria must ensure collaboration with private investors, philanthropists, industries, zakat and endowment foundations and experts in Islamic finance to provide a lasting solution to the poor funding of higher education in the country. © 2020 Kolej University Islam Sultan Azlan Shah.

AB  - Social scientists are not taking philanthropy seriously enough. New approaches to philanthropy such as venture philanthropy, philanthrocapitalism, strategic philanthropy, and effective altruism are creating what is often broadly termed “the new philanthropy.” Living hands-on mega wealthy donors such as Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, and John Arnold have publicly committed their energies and wealth to transforming society through philanthropy. Some of these philanthropic endeavors, notably in K-12 education, are creating jurisdictional challenges to the public sector. Others are approaching transversal and transnational issues in ways that are difficult to do through government policies. This essay provides an overview of these issues and, drawing from the other essays in this symposium, makes the case that scholars should do more research on the social contexts and consequences of philanthropy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study investigates alternative equity-based financing models and proposes a waqf-owned (that could also be called philanthropy-, endowment-, trust-, foundation-, and third sector-based) financial intermediary (WOFI). We do so by developing the agent-based model and scenario-based computer simulations for financing solar powerplants. For this purpose, we redesign a waqf-based financing system and analyze the changes in wealth inequality, capital pooling, and social prosperity for a future time frame. As a proof-of-concept, the simulation results show that for the given case study, the proposed WOFI reduces wealth inequality dramatically, whereas conventional debt-based financing models raise inequality. Besides, restructuring the waqf-based financial intermediaries also enables the capital pooling essential for large projects and absent in the conventional waqf system. In short, this study proves that waqf-based institutions have a remarkable potential to contribute towards sustainable development goals by taking account of long-run social implications, economic growth, and environment-friendly projects. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: This paper attempts to contextualise the potential role of waqf (plural; awqaf, Islamic perpetual trust) in the contemporary world, particularly, in the developmental arena. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for awqaf to maintain its convergence with some of the fundamental goals of the SDGs which are also congruent with the maqasid al-shariah (the higher objectives of shariah). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a desk-based research, and it adopts the qualitative research paradigm for the analysis of the available literature. Findings: This paper finds that most of the 17 developmental goals of the SDGs comfortably match with the long-term objectives of shariah and there is good scope for the stakeholders of awqaf to develop waqf-based development plan in line with the framework of SDGs. Additionally, it finds that the global awqaf enjoy sufficient financial capacity to help muslim majority countries to realise some of the most relevant and urgent maqasid-oriented SDGs in a timely manner. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this paper is limited to analyse the potential role of global awqaf in realising some of the most urgent maqasid-based development objectives in congruence with SDGs. For the purpose of maintaining the coherence in the focus of the study, this paper does not undertake any comparison between the waqf and other forms of endowments/charities in fulfilling the similar objectives. Practical implications: This paper provides a framework for maqasid-oriented waqf-based development plan followed by provision of some critical recommendations on how the global awqaf can potentially spearhead the initiative of Islamic charities in realising the maqasid-oriented SDGs among muslim majority countries. Originality/value: This paper adds original value to the available literature on the potential of waqf in the arena of development. The paper analyses the role of waqf in achieving the most urgent maqasid-based SDGs, and thus, it fills the existing gap of a systematic research on the possible collaboration of global awqaf and SDGs. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study presents a proof-of-concept focusing on sustainable crowdfunding models for renewables as alternatives to conventional financing instruments and proposes a Philanthropic-Crowdfunding-Partnership (PCP) model. In this regard, this research investigates social welfare by evaluating the change in wealth inequality for the future time horizon by simulating conventional and the PCP financing models on solar farms in the case study of Turkey. The motivation is to find a solution for financing regional development in a holistic approach considering society and the environment to accomplish sustainable development. Furthermore, it also aims to provide insights into innovative public-private partnerships to unlock new horizons for development by incorporating citizen participation at large. The PCP model's objective is to mobilize capital throughout the public by prioritizing individuals along with small and medium enterprises over the large corporates in fundraising for renewable energy projects, mainly solar farms. This paper provides quantitative evidence that the PCP functions as a sustainable and alternative financing model by dramatically reducing wealth inequality. Besides, the PCP holds the potential to become a self-sufficient financing mechanism for projects ranging from small ones to mega initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper investigates the charitable giving of Chinese firms from the perspectives of four sustainable development goals (SDGs), including Economy, Operation, Harmony, and Management. By converting corporate financial data into four independent variables, namely Economy, Operation, Harmony, and Management, this study explores philanthropic giving for SDGs. The empirical evidence shows that corporate philanthropy has a significant and positive effect on Economy, Operation and Harmony, and it is negatively related to Management. This study finds that the sample firms would undertake some social responsibilities for the economic and political benefits of legitimization or corporate philanthropy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Maintaining the Earth's climate within habitable boundaries is probably the greatest "public goods game" played by humans. However,with > 6 billion "players" taking part, the game seems to rule out individual altruistic behavior. Thus, climate protection is a problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse, a "tragedy of the commons" problem that emerges in many social dilemmas. We perform a previously undescribed type of public goods experiment with human subjects contributing to a public pool. In contrast to the standard protocol, here the common pool is not divided among the participants; instead, it is promised that the pool will be invested to encourage people to reduce their fossil fuel use. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that players can behave altruistically to maintain the Earth's climate given the right set of circumstances. We find a nonzero basic level of altruistic behavior, which is enhanced if the players are provided with expert information describing the state of knowledge in climate research. Furthermore, personal investments in climate protection increase substantially if players can invest publicly, thus gaining social reputation. This increase occurs because subjects reward other subjects' contributions to sustaining the climate, thus reinforcing their altruism. Therefore, altruism may convert to net personal benefit and to relaxing the dilemma if the gain in reputation is large enough. Our finding that people reward contributions to sustaining the climate of others is a surprising result. There are obvious ways these unexpected findings can be applied on a large scale.

AB  - Two of the most consequential developments affecting US politics are (1) the growing influence of private philanthropy, and (2) the large-scale production and diffusion of misinformation. Despite their importance, the links between these two trends have not been scientifically examined. This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent corporate donors. These findings reveal new knowledge about large-scale efforts to distort public understanding of science and sow polarization. The study also contributes a unique computational approach to be applied at this increasingly important, yet methodologically fraught, area of research. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This article explores the complex relationships between the energy boom, community economic and demographic conditions, and local philanthropy. This study aims to find direct effects of the energy boom and indirect effects of multiple mediators—community economic conditions, population change, racial diversity, and income inequality—on local philanthropy. Methods: Drawing upon data from U.S. counties, a series of mediation analyses are tested by following Baron and Kenney's (1986, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 51(6):1173) causal-steps procedures. Results: The energy boom always has negative direct effects on local philanthropy. Although indirect effects of mediators are not always significant, total effects, as the sum of direct and indirect effects, reveal that income, population growth, and racial diversity positively mediate negative effects of the energy boom on local philanthropy. The energy boom increases levels of income inequality; however, increased income inequality paradoxically is positively associated with local philanthropy. Conclusion: The relationship among the energy boom, community economic and demographic conditions, and local philanthropy is complex. Although direct effects of the energy boom are negative, key findings of positive indirect effects suggest implications for policymakers, nonprofit practitioners, and community leaders when dealing with grand societal challenges caused by natural resource development at the community level. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Despite public support, environmental education (EE) is rarely a priority for funders, even those interested in the environment or education. We examined reasons behind the paucity of EE funding, focusing on U.S. foundations, which are one of the largest sources of support for environmental efforts. We analyzed historical giving data and interviewed a dozen funders. Over the 2003 to 2007 period, we found EE funding represented approximately 5% of overall environment funding in the United States. Reasons for the low level of EE support included definitional complexity, uncertainty about efficacy, and inclusion of EE funding within issue-specific grants, such as those focused on climate change. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Ecotourism is frequently put forward as a potential solution for local development and biodiversity conservation in developing countries. Numerous researchers have looked at the various impacts of ecotourism on development and on conservation. There are, however, few studies looking at the role of stakeholders and the impact they are having on local development. We look specifically at the role of private sector stakeholders in local ecotourism development in southern Africa. We focus on one ecotourism operator, Wilderness Safaris, and our results are based on a desktop analysis of various reports, field work and data from a Ph.D. study looking at the socio-economic impact of private sector ecotourism on local communities. The results show that the private sector has an important role to play in local socio-economic development in terms of employment creation, skills training and development, the payment of lease fees as well as through philanthropic development projects. Recommendations are put forward as to how the private sector can further effect positive change in the areas where it is operating and ensure long-term sustainability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Many public and private entities such as government agencies and private foundations have missions related to the improvement, protection, and sustainability of the environment. In pursuit of their missions, they fund projects with related outcomes. Typically, the funding scene consists of scarce funding dollars for the many project requests. In light of funding limitations and funder's search for innovative funding schemes, a method to support the allocation of scarce dollars among project components is presented. The proposed scheme has similarities to methods in the project selection literature but differs in its focus on project components and its connection to and enumeration of the universe of funding possibilities. The value of having access to the universe is demonstrated with illustrations. The presentation includes Excel implementations that should appeal to a broad spectrum of project evaluators and reviewers. Access to the space of funding possibilities facilitates a rich analysis of funding alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Inspired by the comparison of charity donations among candidates in rural elections, the authors linked the non-profit motives of charity to corporate pollution emissions. And on this basis, the authors aim to provide theoretical and empirical explanations for the relationship between corporate philanthropy and pollution. The authors find that the desire to pursue more pollution emissions stimulates the firm's philanthropy, which is similar to the public welfare donations in rural elections. Design/methodology/approach: Firstly, the authors construct a game-theoretical framework consisting of an entrepreneur and a bureaucrat to study the environmental cost of corporate philanthropy through the impact on pollution emission by the firm. Secondly, the authors used various empirical methods, including hybrid OLS, IV-2SLS, PSM, etc., to empirically test the impact of a firm's philanthropy on corporate pollution emissions. Finally, the authors use the output and abatement input as intermediary variables and apply the intermediary effect model to test the impact mechanism between corporate philanthropy and corporate pollution emissions. Findings: Theoretical model finds that the firm invests more in philanthropy discharges more emissions when the theoretical model is in political equilibrium. Besides, empirical results show that corporate philanthropy will lead to more pollution emissions by reducing abatement input and increasing production. Finally, the heterogeneity test finds that compared with state-owned enterprises, the intention of non-state-owned enterprises' philanthropy for more pollution emission is more obvious. Moreover, the improvement of regional environmental regulation can significantly inhibit the realization of corporate philanthropy's poor motive. Practical implications: The results have obvious policy implications for China's future policy-making. Firstly, regulatory agencies should pay close attention to the charitable behaviors of firms with serious negative environmental externalities, and prevent them from replacing more pollution emissions with philanthropy. Besides, due to weak environmental supervision in rural areas, rural polluting enterprises will be more inclined to make charitable donations to the village collective to obtain more emission rights. Therefore, the government should strengthen environmental supervision in rural areas to prevent enterprises from wanton pollution. Originality/value: By constructing a game-theoretical framework consisting of an entrepreneur and a bureaucrat, the authors expound on corporate philanthropy's pollution motivation and decision-making mechanism for the first time in theory. Besides, this paper finds that the desire to pursue more pollution emissions also stimulates the firm's philanthropy. This paper expands the literature on corporate charitable donation motivations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - While conservation activities are underfunded almost everywhere, the gap between current expenditure and what is needed is particularly extreme in the tropics where threatened species and habitats are most concentrated. We examine how to bridge this funding gap. Firstly, we try to identify who in principle should pay, by comparing the spatial distribution of the costs and the benefits of tropical conservation. The immediate opportunity costs of conservation often exceed its more obvious, management-related costs, and are borne largely by local communities. Conversely, we argue that the greatest benefits of conservation derive from ecological services, and from option, existence, and bequest values; these are often widely dispersed and enjoyed in large part by wealthier national and global beneficiaries. We conclude that the gap in funding tropical conservation should be borne largely by national and especially global communities, who receive most benefit but currently pay least cost. In the second part of the paper we review recent developments in order to examine how in practice increased funding may be raised. There are many growing and novel sources of support: private philanthropy, premium pricing for biodiversity-related goods via certification schemes, and the development of entirely new markets for environmental services. Despite their potential, we conclude that the principal route for meeting the unmet costs of tropical conservation will have to be via governments, and will inevitably require the transfer of substantial resources from north to south. This will be enormously difficult, both politically and logistically, but without it we believe that much of what remains of tropical nature will be lost.

AB  - Many of the social issues private foundations and other philanthropies attempt to address - poverty, homelessness, global climate change - are wicked problems. That is, they defy easy definition, lack permanent solutions, and have multiple stakeholders. The wicked problems framework helps make explicit the challenging nature of the issue to be addressed, requires an inclusive style of leadership that seeks stakeholder involvement, and demands candid exchange among stakeholders about the nature of the problem and effectiveness of efforts to address it. A wicked problems framework provides a set of criteria and questions for evaluators of advocacy efforts to ask all the other stakeholders to asses: (1) the type and quality of leadership provided by the funder, grantees, and other stakeholders in terms of involving stakeholders and fostering a culture of candor; (2) the degree to which leadership and others were candid about the problem, the effectiveness of the strategies, and stakeholder contributions; and (3) quality and contributions of stakeholders. Two recent public policy advocacy efforts and their evaluation are used to highlight some of the issues a wicked problems framework makes apparent, and the possible ramifications if such a framework had been used from the initial stages of the advocacy efforts.

AB  - Purpose: Private philanthropy in China is an emerging element of civil society. This paper seeks to examine the role of productivity improvement in a private charity in the context of the relative roles of charities and private business in building a harmonious society. In addition, the paper aims to examine the philosophy of Capital Spirit proposed by Dr Lu Dezhi, founder of the Huamin Charity Foundation, as the basis for a Chinese model of private philanthropy. Design/methodology/approach: This case study is based on an interview with Dr Lu Dezhi conducted in Beijing by the first author. The article is descriptive, but it also contains analysis of the approach described by Dr Lu in light of the World Confederation of Productivity Science model of SEE-Productivity and previous history of efforts to shift management paradigms, e.g. quality management, etc. Findings: Dr Lu provides a rational, systematic and philosophically grounded approach to creating and operating a private philanthropy in China. This model incorporates many of the key aspects of productivity science, including values-based strategy, data-based decision making, analysis and evaluation and continuous improvement. In a larger sense, Dr Lu outlines a philosophy that has the potential to shift the management paradigms of Chinese organizations to more sustainable practices. Originality/value: The focus on productivity improvement in private philanthropy is a topic that is rarely discussed in the management literature. In addition, the approach taken to philanthropy by Dr Lu Dezhi and his philosophy of Capital Spirit as the basis for a "Chinese model" of philanthropy is unique. Finally, the discussion regarding the appropriate role of private sector businesses in an economy based on its stage of development is a unique contribution to the management literature. Contrasting this Chinese model with Western models provides a useful cultural contrast to examine this key question. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - There has been proliferation of endowments, foundations, NGOs and other organisations operating within many developing countries over the past 20 years as social entrepreneurs/enterprises. These organisations have been supporting and working in developing countries, attempting to transform the quality of lives of their beneficiaries; essentially creating social value. While there is evidence on output and outcome from programmes, there is little evidence of meaningful, sustained impact and hence effectiveness, despite millions of dollars being spent. The lack of this evidence begs the question of the justification for continued funding, state benefits and tax exemptions for the programmes. Additionally, it raises the issue of sustainability of the intervention process, given that the primary source of funding for many of these organisations is grants and/or philanthropic contributions. The paper adopts the Ashoka Foundation's lead, which measures sustainability/vulnerability of supporting organisations and the effectiveness of these entities in creating and sustaining social value. It employs Kushner's Model of 'An Open Systems Model of Organisational Effectiveness' to inform the empirical methodology and develops the instrument used. It furthers the process by employing regression analysis in identifying the significant variables in determining organizational effectiveness. The results show that the organisations 'Ability to Adapt' and 'Resource Adequacy' are significant determinants for organizational effectiveness. The results thus present meaningful insights for funders (foundations, endowments, corporations), policy makers and organizations on how they can improve their effectiveness and justify the financial support they received from their donors.

AB  - Knowledge products comprise assessments of authoritative information supported by standards, governance, quality control, data, tools, and capacity building mechanisms. Considerable resources are dedicated to developing and maintaining knowledge products for biodiversity conservation, and they are widely used to inform policy and advise decision makers and practitioners. However, the financial cost of delivering this information is largely undocumented. We evaluated the costs and funding sources for developing and maintaining four global biodiversity and conservation knowledge products: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, Protected Planet, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These are secondary data sets, built on primary data collected by extensive networks of expert contributors worldwide. We estimate that US$160 million (range: US$116-204 million), plus 293 person-years of volunteer time (range: 278- 308 person-years) valued at US$ 14 million (range US$12-16 million), were invested in these four knowledge products between 1979 and 2013. More than half of this financing was provided through philanthropy, and nearly three-quarters was spent on personnel costs. The estimated annual cost of maintaining data and platforms for three of these knowledge products (excluding the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems for which annual costs were not possible to estimate for 2013) is US$6.5 million in total (range: US$6.2-6.7 million).We estimated that an additional US$114 million will be needed to reach pre-defined baselines of data coverage for all the four knowledge products, and that once achieved, annual maintenance costs will be approximately US$12 million. These costs are much lower than those to maintain many other, similarly important, global knowledge products. Ensuring that biodiversity and conservation knowledge products are sufficiently up to date, comprehensive and accurate is fundamental to inform decision-making for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Thus, the development and implementation of plans for sustainable long-Term financing for them is critical. © 2016 Adel et al.

AB  - Examining all donations of one-million dollars or more to environmental and animal-related causes from 2000–10 in the U.S., this paper employs network methodologies to identify structural patterns in elite philanthropy. Employing k-plex algorithms, analysis demonstrates robust, overlapping donor-recipient ties forming meaningful subcomponents within the larger network. In addition to donor-recipient subgroups that partition along major environmental and animal-related issues, we find politically polarized subcomponents among organizations engaged in energy and climate change. Here it is argued that these observed substructures in the network reflect an intra-elite fracture that mirrors ideological differences of donors and a larger partisan polarization on these issues in the U.S. These findings substantiate a critical theory of foundations and elite philanthropy that accounts for their role in establishing, maintaining, and at times contesting forms of political hegemony favorable to their factional interests. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined the role of the First Nations beneficiary charities in contributing to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Northern Territory, Australia, as a way of attaining self-determination by closing the expectations gap between First Nations people and the mainstream Australians. Informed by the theory of self-determination (ethical and functional strands), a latent content analysis of 118 charities serving the First Nations people was conducted, coding the summary of their activities to ascertain their strategic engagement with the SDGs. A network analysis was also carried out to examine the charities’ connections with each other and their collective contribution towards the SDGs. The findings show that charities contribute to creating cultural capital through social capital, followed by intellectual capital dimensions. However, charities contributed little to building environmental capital dimension of the First Nations people. This study examined charities’ engagement with SDGs to build cultural capital in furtherance of self-determination of Australia’s First Nations people. © 2022 by the authorLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper examines the nexus of coal–government–society relations in present-day China using a governmentality approach to explore the interactions between policy change, “crisis” management and social action. It outlines the noticeable shift in government rationalities and communication regarding the coal industry in recent years. It then frames this shift within the broader context of government–society relations focusing on public debate regarding the calamitous nature of China’s air pollution and its filtering via the censorship apparatus of the Communist Party-state. Finally, it shows how problems relating to coal extraction and combustion have been taken up at the level of grass-roots protest and philanthropic advocacy. An examination of such activism illustrates the crucial role played by digital media networks in sparking debate on coal-related environmental and health crises, and in pushing an authoritarian government to change national coal and other policies in order to maintain social and political stability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Geographically, the study ’encompassed all the assistance projects awarded in 1991–2016 involving beneficiaries from Pskovskaya Oblast’. This region is potentially an important target for EU investments in environmental infrastructure, due to its location by the EU border and high value of natural capital. The study demonstrates how the assumptions offered by the international aid literature (mostly derived from the global South) apply to Russia. We found major limitations to the assumption that co-financing provided by recipients ensures project effectiveness (demonstrating the acceptance of the donor's agenda) or sustainability (providing interest to the maintenance of outputs). Tangible assets are normally co-financed only if the investment was in agenda anyway (and therefore the donor gets only time gains, although this can be a valid purpose too); soft outputs (plans, surveys, policies, etc.) are usually co-financed in-kind, and therefore cannot secure any additional commitment. Likewise, physical infrastructure often ends up mismanaged due to low or no maintenance budgets available, while maintenance of soft outputs is too much dependent on contextual factors beyond the co-finance paradigm. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - For an organization to become a low-carbon community, delivering a range of sustainability initiatives is necessary. Renewable energy (RE) initiatives, offering a source of low-carbon electricity to offset an organization's energy needs, fit with this objective. This paper examines the role of innovation in achieving low-carbon energy in the National Trust (NT), a conservation charity and the largest landowner in the UK. It considers how an eco-design approach to delivering innovative RE projects, specifically hydropower (HP) installations, has supported their transition to a low-carbon community. Three HP projects delivered on time and within budget were examined; support for each was built through transparent and regular communications with the NT's membership. Despite limited resources and funding for innovation, the NT minimized the associated risk through effective management and external collaboration. It fostered an open environment for creativity and idea sharing, which was key to delivering the RE projects. Innovation was particularly evident in the HP initiatives explored, as eco-design considerations informed new and innovative design choices and technology selection as each HP project was designed and constructed. Transitioning to a low-carbon community is an achievable reality for a conservation charity, and this is enabled through the management of innovation to deliver solutions that meet the low-carbon energy challenge. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The research relies primarily on secondary and descriptive in the study. The study results show that India, the world’s most populous democracy, is about to launch a SSE in 2021 which will serve as a mediator between social enterprises that need funding and investors who are willing to invest their money and by designing and providing robust solutions which transform the habit of charity into a culture of social investment. Exchange focuses more on the development of the ecosystem, emphasizing policy and regulatory advocacy where Social ends and profit motives do not contradict each other. This implies profit generation for social purposes is a key sustainability feature. SSE should be a means for the markets to serve the society not for society to serve the markets. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The article identifies that an important area of sustainable development and public administration reform is an effective e-government process, which should be provided with appropriate funding. The purpose of the article is to determine further opportunities for financing e-government of Ukraine in the framework of projects and public administration reform, taking into account the experience of the European Union to achieve the goals of sustainable development and digitalization of the country. The methodological basis of the study is the analytical data of UNDP Ukraine, the National Agency for Civil Service Affairs of Ukraine, the European Commission, the study of the digital government of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The key factors of the state in the direction of digital society and sustainable democratic governance are identified (human rights, transparency and integrity, parliamentary reform, civil society and youth work, health care reform and public procurement support, digital transformation). Peculiarities of financing the Public Administration Reform Strategy of Ukraine are analyzed, the largest share of financing of which is the budget program "Support to the implementation of comprehensive public administration reform" and EU budget support. The peculiarities of e-government financing in the EU countries are determined. The necessity of external sources of financing of digital projects in Ukraine due to their insufficient financing is substantiated. The largest donor countries for financing e-government projects in Ukraine (Denmark, Estonia, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Poland) have been identified. Based on the study of European experience in financing models of e-government development projects, existing funding instruments for Ukraine (funds of the joint interstate development strategy, grants, charity, public-private partnership) and promising funding instruments have been identified, the use of which will increase openness, transparency and efficiency and ensure the development of open data.

Yet calls for change go unanswered. With a critical perspective on philanthropy, an understanding of power and historical reflexivity, this article helps develop our understanding of why business schools are so deeply rooted in managerialism and so resistant to change. Through archival research, I show how the Ford Foundation used its money and influence in the 1950s to embed a managerialist ideology in American business schools as part of its efforts to sustain and strengthen the capitalist system. Through its outward face of objectivity and neutrality, combined with targeted support of specific schools, individuals and research, the Ford Foundation went beyond shaping the structure and curriculum of business schools to shaping the ideology and identities of management scholars. The more that we, as business academics, understand the full histories of our own institutions and the often hidden or ignored sources of power that played a role in their development, the easier it will be to change business schools in ways that fit our current contexts and support our current and future needs. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The reinsurance sector and the property sector of the insurance industry are already vulnerable to variability in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (Dlugolecki et al. 1996), and are increasingly concerned about the financial implications of the effect of climate change on future trends in natural disaster losses. Internationally and in Australia, the insurance industry could respond to the threat of climate change reactively; or it could respond in a more pro-active manner, encouraging adaptation to climate change at the individual and governmental levels. The issues surrounding the potential impacts of climate change on the property insurance industry and the consequent implications are reviewed. A generalised economic framework is developed to establish the position and role of insurance in disaster relief in Australia. Analysis of four case studies of floods and bushfires in south and east Australia reveal the absolute and relative damage costs borne by insurance, government and charity, and the residual costs borne by the affected parties. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper examines a philanthropy-led initiative which has as its objective to jump start the transition to a more sustainable and just food system in California. The first major project funded was a "vivid picture" of California's food system twenty-five years in the future. The outcome of the project is a report that is glossed with the tropes of neoliberalism in all of its key organizing frameworks, analytics, cognitive maps, and idioms and argues for "opportunities-based approaches" as the engine of change. Yet, as described in the paper, this outcome was initially under-determined, and, in fact, the funders had originally intended to leverage their resources for large scale transformation. By examining four moments in the development of the Vivid Picture project, the grantee selection, the modeling exercise, the stakeholder meetings, and the qualitative interviews, this paper will show how existing techniques of neoliberal governance such as modeling, audit, best-practices, and stakeholder participation, as well as current norms of philanthropy, shaped what is thinkable and hence actable. It will also show how "stakeholders" played a constitutive role in producing the outcomes of the project, in part because their input reflected already-developed notions of the possible within the current climate of neoliberalism. In the end it will argue that the failure of the Vivid Picture to look beyond the neoliberal present is itself evidence of the proliferation of neoliberal governmentalities. Still, the entire process galvanized many of the movement actors who were left out of the funding process and, in that way, produced political openings. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article addresses the growing problem of implementing and executing the concept of social responsibility. The research began with a review of literature on strategic approaches to defining the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility, and by placing the subject in an international context. The role of a corporate foundation, as an executive tool for CSR projects, was reviewed. The research group consisted of selected joint stock companies, members of the only index in Poland related to social activity (WIG-ESG), operating in the mining sector and related sectors. The main objective of the research was 1. to identify the trend of strategic approach to social responsibility in the research group, 2. to define the existence of foundations in the entities' organizational structure, 3. to identify CSR activities at the time of pandemic as corporate and/or corporate foundation activities. The research methodology was based on the use of research methods, i.e. literature review according to the keywords, case study, comparative method. In the descriptive part, the difference between the CSR strategy, Sustainable Development, Creating Shared Value, and the Responsible Business Conduct approach was identified. The results section indicates which strategy is known and used in the research group. Then the role of the corporate foundation in the strategy of CSR activities was indicated, the forms of these activities were grouped as corporate and corporate foundation activities. The coincidence of the operational CSR strategy of companies with the statutes of corporate foundations, translates into CSR practices, both from the operational level of the entity and from the foundation. The added value is to examine the relation of the employment structure and answer the question if representatives of the founding company (management board, supervisory board) sit on the foundation's bodies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We discuss the changing role of national governments in addressing global environmental problems. Although many expect global leadership from collaborating national governments, formalised in international agreements, real global leadership and authority are hampered by the national interests governments have to represent. Circumstances, such as the perceived urgency of global threats that cannot be mitigated by any nation on its own, and the openness to international cooperation, influence the willingness of governments to give up national sovereignty in order to establish international authority. Based on these factors, four scenarios are presented that outline future governance settings in which global environmental problems such as climate change have to be addressed. Subsequently, we analyse the role of the business community and civil society, including large philanthropic organisations, in complementing governmental actions by initiating new approaches in cooperation, introducing new technological solutions, and speeding up technical transitions. We argue that the role of these societal actors is relevant in all scenarios discussed. © Frank Wijen, Kees Zoeteman, Jan Pieters, and Paul van Seters 2012. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the drivers and barriers in the transition of the social responsibility agenda of large, emerging economy (EE) firms from non-strategic philanthropy to strategic corporate sustainability. This study also suggests a strategy that such firms may adopt for obtaining the desired corporate social responsibility (CSR) manifestation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows an in-depth case study approach of a large, family-managed Indian firm in a pollutant industry – Sudarshan Chemicals. The article is based on direct observation and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, namely, senior management, employees and the local community members (villagers) in the company’s plant in Maharashtra. Findings: The study exposes a lack of alignment between firm size (large) and firm CSR manifestation (small) as the key challenge that EE firms face in transforming their social responsibility agenda. Stuck in the mould of non-strategic corporate philanthropy, even large EE companies are not exposed to the three essential elements of the Western conceptualization of CSR, namely, stakeholder pressure, environmental concerns and integration into core business. Sudarshan’s small-firm CSR orientation can be seen as symptomatic of most Indian companies which are family-led, family-managed businesses. Practical implications: Faced with strong drivers to incorporate CSR, EE firms can strategize to leap-frog from philanthropy to corporate sustainability through obtaining the desired CSR manifestation. Originality/value: The significance of this paper lies in the “on the ground”, detailed and empirical study of the drivers and challenges faced by a large Indian company, as it proactively sought to transition from the philanthropy orientation towards strategic CSR/sustainability. The paper identifies the major challenge large, Indian corporates are likely to face going forward, as they respond to drivers in a globalized business environment. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This chapter examines the roles performed by four groups: key agricultural scientists, many of them American Society of Agronomy members; American private foundations; governments of both poor and rich nations; and newly created institutions such as the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and the international centers themselves. Together, International Rice Research Center and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center became the catalyst for the Green Revolution, obtaining critical contributions from many key government officials and collaborating scientists from national programs to achieve international success. In 1967, Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, in collaboration with the host countries, created two more centers: The International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, in Nigeria, and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, in Colombia. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation have formed The Alliance for A Green Revolution in Africa. Its goal: to help start a new sustainable and equitable Green Revolution in Africa. © 2010 by American Society of Agronomy, Inc.

AB  - To combat climate change and hunger, a number of governments, foundations and aid agencies have called for a 'New Green Revolution'. Such calls obfuscate the dynamics of the Green Revolution. Using Arrighi's analysis of capital accumulation cycles, it is possible to trace a Long Green Revolution that spans the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Such an analysis illuminates commonalities in past and present Green Revolutions, including their bases in class struggles and crises of accumulation, modes of governance - particularly in the links between governments and philanthropic institutions - and the institutions through which truths about agricultural change were produced and became known. Such an analysis also suggests processes of continuity between the original Green Revolution and features of twenty-first-century agricultural change, while providing a historical grounding in international financial capital's structural changes to help explain some of the novel features that accompany the New Green Revolution, such as 'land grabs', patents on life, and nutritionism. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Accounting for only 3% of Indian crops, it had the merit of being an agricultural ‘sandbox’ in which the Foundation could experiment in ways similar to its forays in Mexico, whilst building institutional support for its approach. It was a full eight years later, in 1964, that wheat was funded by the Foundation, and only in 1965, during India’s food crisis, did rice join the program (Lele and Goldsmith 1989, 318). Recall that the Green Revolution is remembered largely as an intervention in rice and wheat production (Pinstrup-Andersen and Hazell 1985). Yet in Mexico its greatest success was with wheat. In India, the Revolution began with corn. So why is the received narrative so wildly at odds with the actual unfolding of the Green Revolution as an extra-governmental process of public policy transformation?']

AB  - Transition in practice means that diverse organizations - from private foundations to citizen-led movements for "cities in transition" - are experiencing ways to bring about sustainable transitions at the system level. While academic thinking on sustainability transitions can efficiently inform transition in practice, these organizations' initiatives can enrich the analytic understanding of transitions. It is this mutually beneficial trade-off that became the purpose of the action research project with the French private foundation Fondaterra, and which led to the drafting of Fondaterra's own model in piloting eco-innovations towards transition. This paper outlines the main features of the Fondaterra model: the territorial perspective, the idea of piloting change, espousing prospective visions, creating new chains of value, implementing demonstrators and monitoring. The comparison of this model with the transition management model suggests that the latter may resonate with other intervention methodologies that have been developed with strong concern for governance strategies, and that many configurations of transition in practice led by intermediary organizations could achieve tangible results in triggering transitions. © 2013 ICCR Foundation.

AB  - Building capacity in ocean affairs, the law of the sea, and marine scientific research in relation to the needs of developing countries is an integral part of the U. Convention on the Law of the Sea and associated instruments, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO) treaty regime. This article traces the development of capacity-building initiatives at the World Maritime University (WMU) over the past three decades, including the establishment of the WMU–Sasakawa Global Ocean Institute in 2018. The establishment of the new institute should be viewed within the wider context of the extraordinary philanthropy of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the Nippon Foundation in building human resource capacity and in supporting advanced academic research on complicated and contentious ocean issues. The article describes the extensive consultation process that informs the research, education, and capacity development agenda of the new institute, including work on the ocean-related goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study uses a field experiment involving 251 adult participants to determine which messages related to climate change, extreme weather events, and decaying infrastructure are most effective in encouraging people to pay more for investments that could alleviate future water-quality risks. The experiment also assesses whether people prefer the investments to be directed toward gray or green infrastructure projects. Messages about global warming induced climate change and decaying infrastructure lead to larger contributions than messages about extreme weather events. The results suggest that people are likely to pay more for green infrastructure projects than for gray infrastructure projects. © The Author(s) 2016.

KW  - ['Advice', 'Charities', 'Energy monitors', 'Fuel poverty', 'Household-level']
AB  - This article explores the impacts of a charity project which aimed to help people vulnerable to fuel poverty improve their energy efficiency and reduce energy costs, through providing energy monitors and advice at a household-level. The research makes an important contribution to emerging but scarce research on how charities can help households vulnerable to fuel poverty. Interviews were conducted with 40 participants and 32 participants described how the project helped them (through one or a combination of the following): reduce inefficient energy use; switch tariffs; change from pre-payment meters; apply for subsidies for vulnerable people; and/ or improve their confidence to manage their household energy needs. Nineteen of the participants were vulnerable to fuel poverty and fifteen of these estimated that the project helped them save money. While achieving financial savings was the key motivation for participants, 15 households described that they participated in the project to reduce their CO2 emissions. However, the approach was limited and the impacts could have been increased through energy audits, property-level energy efficiency improvements, and support to raise issues with housing providers. The research argues that household-level face-to-face advice and support can help people vulnerable to fuel poverty and charities can operate effectively in a space between the government, energy companies, local authorities and households to provide this support. However, charities need access to technical expertise, reflexive funding, and effective coordination with local authorities to improve their long-term impact. © 2020

AB  - Slow-onset events (SOE) such as sea level rise, desertification, salinisation, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and forests or glacial retreat fall under loss and damage (L&D) from climate change impacts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and are increasingly threatening the environment and people's livelihoods. Irreversible SOE are closely linked to non-economic losses (NEL) such as health, human mobility or loss of ecosystem services. Neither L&D from SOE nor NELs have a dedicated funding stream. By reviewing literature on philanthropy and solidarity funds, this article aims to identify a continuous source of finance and distribution mechanism for addressing L&D impacts from SOE and NELs. This paper concludes that there is a convincing case to approach philanthropic organisations to systematically mobilise funds into a solidarity type arrangement. With adjustments, the architecture of the European Union Solidarity Fund is a promising example to administer and distribute finances for L&D from SOE and NELs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.
