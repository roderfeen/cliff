corporation with respect to its social responsibility. the shift in approach is reflected in a move from philanthropy to pragmatism as stakeholders have increasing expectations of business to not only spend their corporate social responsibility funds more wisely but to weave social responsibility throughout the fabric of the business. in this new context, what are the implications for leadership what are the qualities of leadership that are required how do we develop leadership with a social lens do we need a new breed of social leaders to shift corporate social responsibility from philanthropy to pragmatism it is these questions that this paper explores. as a starting point, a series of research questions on leadership and corporate social responsibility were developed. these research questions guided the development of the qualitative and quantitative data collection inclusive of a literature review, an online survey and one-on-one focus interviews. over 300 people participated in the research. the research showed that there are clear motivations, enablers and challenges to social leaders and corporate social responsibility. the motivators are personal values and expectations of others. collaboration, self-awareness and working with purpose and vision are all considered critical enablers. in addition the respondents of the survey indicated that systems thinking and diversity are important enablers. challenges include organisation culture, time and energy, resources, remuneration and us and them worldviews. in summary, it was found that social leadership is closely aligned with leadership in general, but there are some specific motivations, enablers and challenges that people found in applying the social lens to their leadership. it was also found there are significant benefits to social leadership and that investing in developing social leadership has merit. while it is clear leadership matters, not just any leadership will be effective in contributing to corporate social responsibility. in a world characterised by complex and multifaceted environmental and social problems with no simple or ready answers, there is need for social leaders-leaders whose focus is on contributing to the common good. for social leadership to thrive to enable the move from philanthropy to pragmatism in corporate social responsibility, there are a number of things that need to be embraced. these include: 1. working collaboratively-working across functions, sectors and disciplines and being willing to abandon an individual agenda for a collective one. 2. letting go of outdated stereotypes of the other and searching for common ground. 3. self-awareness-of their emotions, strengths, the complexity of the system in which they operate. 4. mainstreaming-allowing leaders to lead for the common good as part of their everyday work, not just as an add-on.", "keywords": null, "publisher": "serials publications", "notes": "export date: 26

transplantation. the aim of this study is to establish the safety and activity of dose-dense brentuximab vedotin combined with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (bv-ice) chemotherapy in second-line treatment of classical hodgkin lymphoma. methods: we conducted a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 study of dose-dense bv-ice at the seattle cancer care alliance, university of washington (seattle, wa, usa). eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older diagnosis of first relapse, primary refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma after one previous line of therapy measurable disease of at least 1 cm in the longest axis, ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with pet within the past 28 days eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 01 and adequate organ function. a 3 3 dose escalation study was done for the phase 1 part of the trial to establish the maximum tolerated dose to be used for the phase 2 study. brentuximab vedotin was delivered on days 1 and 8 at either 12 mg/kg (dose level 1) or 15 mg/kg (dose level 2) intravenously (capped at 150 mg) with standard dosing of ice on days 13 (ifosfamide 5 g/m2 plus mesna 5 g/m2 intravenously over 24 h on day 2, carboplatin area under the curve 5 on day 2 in one intravenous injection, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 13 in one intravenous injection per day) for two 21-day cycles. the primary endpoint was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (phase 1 part) and complete response rate after two cycles, with a prespecified target of 78 (phase 2 part). safety analysis was done in all enrolled participants and the primary activity analysis was done in all patients with evaluable response data. this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (nct02227199) enrolment and study treatment are complete. findings: between oct 16, 2014, and feb 10, 2020, we enrolled 45 patients with a median age of 31 years (iqr 2845). the recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin was established to be 15 mg/kg. after a median follow-up of 31 years (iqr 1741), 32 (74 95 ci 588865) of 43 evaluable patients had complete responses after two cycles of treatment. grade 34 haematological toxic effects were common, including neutropenia (33 73), anaemia (six 13), and thrombocytopenia (36 80). the most common grade 34 non-haematological toxic effects were febrile neutropenia (four 9), sepsis (six 13), increased alanine aminotransferase (five 11), hyperglycaemia (three 7), pulmonary embolism (two 4), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (two 4). there was one (2) on-treatment death due to multisystem organ failure that was considered treatment related. serious adverse events occurred in 13 (29) patients. interpretation: our data suggest that dose-dense bv-ice is a rapidly administered and active salvage regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma despite a complete response in this trial lower than the prespecified phase 2 target. although cross-trial comparisons should be made with caution, activity results seem to be similar to previously presented brentuximab vedotin chemotherapy salvage combinations delivered over much longer durations and can be considered in young (lt60 years), transplantation-eligible patients for second-line therapy. funding: seagen, lymphoma research foundation, national institutes of health/national

and brand promotion initiatives are often non-commensurate to expenses,having short-lived effects, and lacking the embracive capacity to affect the perceptions of diverse stakeholdersof the organisations for positive image, reputation and overall competitive positioning. consequently,the study examined the impact that social responsibility as an alternative means of shoring up corporate image before various stakeholders (customers, employees, regulators, host community, and government among others),can have on the image perceptions of manufacturing firms in nigeria in their quest to evolve long-term winning strategies to appeal to diverse stakeholders like customers, employees, investors, regulatory agencies, among the rest. the study adopted survey research with 400 copies of questionnaire to respondents from seven consumer goods manufacturing firms based in south-west nigeria. the hypothesis was tested with regression analysis and the result indicated that there was a positively significant relationship between social responsibility and corporate image enhancement of manufacturing firms in nigeria. the study recommends that manufacturing practitioners in nigeria should realign their business promotion communications by blending strategic management of their social responsibility initiatives into them, for better and longer lasting corporate image for due competitiveness. also it is recommended that manufacturers should paypremium attention to philanthropic responsibility dimension, because the results showed that it has better influence on corporate image enhancement. in the main, the study findings re-affirmed that various stakeholders like customers, investors, regulators, host community, etc will have positive perceptions of corporate image of the firms, when the social responsibility is effectively managed, thereby leading to better business performance and competitiveness. beiesp.", "keywords": "competitive, image, manufacturing, social

not just by those many organizations with superb performance records, but also by the few whose achievements fall far short of donor expectations and public perceptions. one of the core competencies of npos should be the ability to build strong donor relationships (lewis, 1998), to create a sustainable income model which allows the organization to focus on their operational efforts. funding uncertainties affect the ability to operate, to motivate and to plan for the future. research (mueller et al., 2004) was undertaken to determine how the relationship between npos and donors can be improved. this work focused on the identification of areas where npos need support to improve their governance and management functions. both donors and npos were investigated, and the results were used to speculate in which areas external support would be most helpful and where donor/npo perceptions differ. npos and donors indicated that they are aware that npos require both governance and managerial support. both the npos and the donors indicated that an objective evaluation system would be valuable to them as evidence of credibility. such a system would also help to guide the internal assessment process. these findings led to the development of the looking glass evaluation tool (lget) which measures an organization along the following dimensions: effective management, strategic planning, advocacy, legal framework, governance and fundraising. the dimensions were derived partly from the work of lester salamon from the nathan cummings foundation, new york. the lget questions an organization about its levels of understanding, planning and implementation of governance and managerial functions and provides a snapshot of the organizations structural effectiveness. the tool does not test the outcomes of the organizations work but speculates that an organization with poor internal structure will be less likely to perform sustainably, especially in the area of creating strong donor relationships. the tool is completed through a guided self-assessment process, which is then reviewed with the organization to assure a clear understanding of the review objectives. from this snapshot of performance in a wide range of areas, organizations can focus resources on specific parts of their work for improvement. the lget has been trialled in its prototype form in a number of npos in new zealand, including a maori charitable trust and has been favorably received. emerlad group publishing limited.", "keywords": "governance, new zealand, non-profit organizations",

line with and supports the companys strategic vision and goals. social business as described and promoted by nobel peace prize laureate professor muhammad yunus, the father of microcredits and the founder of grameen bank in bangladesh, is a relatively new member of the corporate social responsibility and corporate sustainability tool kits. just like any kind of philanthropic activity, it has the goal of creating social value without pursuing any financial gains for its investors or donors, but it does so in a business format, using a market-based approach and striving for financial sustainability. this chapter describes how social business is used in the corporate world and explores how it can be used to move in direction 1 toward a companys sustainability frontier, and even push it out further. after a brief introduction to the concept, this chapter will draw on international and latin american case studies, including the current social business investment of florida ice and farm company (analyzed in chapters 2 and 9) to describe its potential roll-out and impact on the companys financial, social and environmental performance. urs p. jager and vijay sathe 2014. all

studies in the supply chain management field take either a supplier or a manufacturer perspective that address predominantly corporate social responsibility (csr) issues referring to the internal stakeholders. our research integrates the literature on supplier, manufacturer, and customer responsibility and proposes the concept of supply chain social sustainability (scss) that refers to addressing social issues within the overall (upstream and downstream) supply chain. furthermore, we develop and empirically validate scales for measuring scss using in-depth interviews and a survey in the indian manufacturing industry. our results suggest that scss consists of six underlying dimensions, namely equity, safety, health and welfare, philanthropy, ethics, human rights, in a 20-item valid and reliable scale. we discuss the implications of the findings for research and practice and suggest future research avenues.

as a result of business conduct exploiting resources in the host markets, exploitation of human resources as well as attempts to manipulate governments to gain preferential treatment. the drive to sustain the value extraction within tight time schedules in order to deliver commodities as contracted, from markets in the southern hemisphere to northern hemisphere business, led to labour practices and business conduct which aroused protest and opposition in the exploited markets. international human rights organisations gradually responded by labelling business contravening best practice publically as exploitative and not doing business in good faith. global activism against business exploitation led to the formulation of principles of good conduct, which fed into more formal programmes of responsible business conduct. the early post-industrialisation history in britain has witnessed benevolent actions by well-intended businessmen to alleviate the plight of poor labour, or the poor in the industrialised urban society. these actions were primarily philanthropic, but were later supplemented by entrepreneurial activity to conduct better business. this paper recognises the long history of responsible conduct by business with respect to the needs of the broader society, but it presents a case study of a life assurer in south africa, sanlam. sanlam was not forced by any

to the education of people whereby they would be empowered to take responsibility for their own lives, was the overarching purpose of the company. it was argued that empowerment of the people is the only method of creating real benefits to the entire south african society (which meant everybody living in south africa), which was the ultimate goal of the life assurer. sanlam implemented corporate social engagement to empower its policyholders, to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the south african economy and thereby to the benefit of all south africans. this paper explores the sanlam corporate social engagement programmes from 1918 to 1980 to illustrate the successful implementation of csr long before csr became a political tool. it is argued that when csr is voluntary and linked directly to stakeholders, such programmes serve to build successful csr and create real benefit to the recipients as well as the broader society. a historical analysis is made of the rationale of sanlam management in implementing programmes to facilitate empowerment of policyholders, the education of needy children as well as bursary schemes for university study. these actions were supplemented by programmes to enable schools to build hostels for school children. sanlam provided credit to people in need of credit, but who would not qualify for credit at ordinary bank institutions, as well as mortgages on agricultural land as a means of empowering its policyholders. sanlam advocated its role as mutual assurer to provide security to its policyholders. therefore sanlam offered access to credit, or a postponement of the payment of policy premiums in case of temporary inability to pay, since thereby the company was seen to practise what it preached: security through life assurance to the people and then through them being secure, greater stability to the south african society and economic progress for everybody living in the country in the long run.

manifesting the long-term relationship of cash waqfs with economic, political and social events throughout studies that will be conducted using the same methods on other registries. by a comparison made between two courts later on, it will query as to which degree the findings support each other. in order to obtain a sustainable series from the first documents that majorly include data from the 19th century, the foundation accounting court, which mostly include data from the 17th and 18th centuries, was chosen as the research space. 109 endowments, which use the cash waqf operation method, were determined amongst the foundations that were approved by the foundation accounting court. when the endowments found were completed with the previous study, a series of 420 years were obtained through the examination of 312 charities between 1491-1911. it was understood that the cash waqfs, which were established essentially for the same purpose during the process, manifested different particularities depending on the wishes by persons and the period they were established. they gathered in special ottoman foundations called avanz during some periods very low amounts were devoted in other periods and whereas public works were at the forefront at some periods other periods put emphasis education. an emphasis was made on the causation of such behaviors and an evaluation was made about their impacts on daily lives.", "keywords": "ottoman, istanbul, foundation, cash waqf, endowment, foundation accounting court", "publisher": null, "notes": "times cited in web of science core

relatively new in others, it has recently ascended in popularity as a hiv-reduction intervention, particularly in areas with high rates of hiv but low rates of mc. however, the uptake and potential effectiveness of mc may be hampered by uneven levels of provider training and procedure skill within developing country settings. indeed, this procedure that is otherwise considered simple and safe has witnessed complication rates as high as 25-35 in some areas, leaving some men with irreversible injuries. to improve the transparency of procedure quality for prospective patients, i borrow from a classic economics approach and advocate a new application in the form of provider certification. building on some experience in the healthcare systems and economic rationale of high-income counties, i explore the potential for certifying providers ofmcin low-income countries and compare and contrast three models of implementation: government agency, private certifiers and private mc device manufacturers. the hope is that increased transparency of provider quality through any or all three types of certifying programmes can better assist local men as they navigate this otherwise complex and unclear medical care market. as more resources are being devoted to mc scale up, i argue that certification should be considered for incorporation as a means of complementing both current and future efforts in order to enhance the effectiveness of mc campaigns. the two models based on privatized certification, as opposed to having the local government underwrite the intervention, may prove most useful when public or philanthropic funding is volatile or incomplete for a given location. the timing formc campaign adoption and desired speed of scale upmay vary across countries in ways that international assistance efforts cannot always immediately and flexibly adapt to. as such, the role of the diversemc provider marketplace and accompanying quality-revelationmechanisms may take on different levels of importance and expediency across settings as individual countries move forward with their respective hiv prevention campaigns. the subsequent challenge is to creatively design solutions that are sustainable and applicable within diverse host-country environments and expectations. this is where i believe some economic insights are currently lacking in the mc dialogue. although i believe the three certification models exhibit much potential for enhancing medical care delivery in developing countries, they are not without their challenges, and implementation would not necessarily be a simple process. local levels of medical knowledge, public and private resource constraints and the integrity of local business transactions and government practices would likely influence the nature and success of a certification intervention. however, with sufficient model adaptability and partnerships across public and private sectors, i argue that many of these implementation issues could be proactively addressed. creative and careful certification structures should ultimately improve the mc circumstances across a variety of developing countries. 2012 adis

resources are being devoted to mc scale up, i argue that certification should be considered for incorporation as a means of complementing both current and future efforts in order to enhance the effectiveness of mc campaigns. the two models based on privatized certification, as opposed to having the local government underwrite the intervention, may prove most useful when public or philanthropic funding is volatile or incomplete for a given location. the timing for mc campaign adoption and desired speed of scale up may vary across countries in ways that international assistance efforts cannot always immediately and flexibly adapt to. as such, the role of the diverse mc provider marketplace and accompanying quality-revelation mechanisms may take on different levels of importance and expediency across settings as individual countries move forward with their respective hiv prevention campaigns. the subsequent challenge is to creatively design solutions that are sustainable and applicable within diverse host-country environments and expectations. this is where i believe some economic insights are currently lacking in the mc dialogue. although i believe the three certification models exhibit much potential for enhancing medical care delivery in developing countries, they are not without their challenges, and implementation would not necessarily be a simple process. local levels of medical knowledge, public and private resource constraints and the integrity of local business transactions and government practices would likely influence the nature and success of a certification intervention. however, with sufficient model adaptability and partnerships across public and private sectors, i argue that many of these implementation issues could be proactively addressed. creative and careful certification structures should ultimately improve the mc circumstances across a variety of developing countries.", "keywords": null, "publisher": null,

annual and sustainability reports of these companies were analysed by means of content analysis. keywords relating to economic empowerment, hiv/aids, other health and safety issues, environmental impact as well as training and education were counted. these issues were also categorised in terms of carrolls (1979 1991) corporate social responsibility (csr) pyramid, which consists of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. although the total number of pages dedicated to csr issues increased in four of the sample companies over the period 2005 to 2008, the keywords-per-page-ratio has decreased or remained constant for all of them. in 2008 anglo platinum had the highest keywords-per-page-ratio (1.03) followed by anglogold ashanti (1.01), harmony gold mining company (0.88), gold fields (0.86) and drdgold (0.53). drdgolds low keywords-per-page-ratio could be a result of its comparatively smaller size and its non-compliance with the gris sustainability reporting guidelines. the most important csr issues reported on by mining companies in all four years were that of hiv/aids as well as other health and safety issues. the fact that these csr issues ranked first and second respectively can be attributed to the direct costs they inflict on the mining companies profits. this finding makes intuitive sense as companies need to take care of those csr issues that impact on their bottom line before they can redistribute earnings to meet other ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. given the adverse impact that mining companies have on the natural environment it is not surprising to note the relatively low importance given to these issues in the companies annual and sustainability reports. and it certainly is not a case of no news is good news. it is also worrying that csr issues relating to training and education have such a low overall priority as one would expect that trained employees would be more productive and hence have a positive impact on profitability. it is, however, encouraging that csr issues relating to training and education have received more attention in the companiesannual and sustainability reports in the course of the evaluation period. the increased reporting on economic empowerment issues could be indicative of the fact that mining companies are starting to go beyond the letter of the law by better communicating their efforts in this regard to their stakeholders. drdgold had the highest percentage of csr keywords reported on in four of the six csr categories in 2005 and in two of six categories in 2006, 2007 and 2008. closer inspection, however, reveals that its csr reporting is not balanced as close to 80 percent of its csr reporting focuses on hiv/aids and other health and safety issues. drdgold is the smallest mining company in the sample and does not subscribe to the gri sustainability reporting guidelines. it does not publish a separate sustainability report and had the lowest overall csr keyword-per-page ratio. this finding points to the fact that stakeholders need to look beyond the glossy pages of companies sustainability reports when evaluating csr performance. it also confirms that sustainability reports are often written to portray companies in the best possible light, especially when it comes to promoting their csr initiatives. in this case more information does not necessarily translate into better information. the local mining sector cannot ignore the importance of csr issues as doing so might risk them becoming ostracised by stakeholders. in recent years institutional investors across the globe and in south africa have become more critical in terms of their portfolio selection criteria and ownership policies. more investors are considering environmental, social and corporate governance issues as they are recognising the adverse impact that these risk factors can have on the future profitability if left unmanaged by investee companies. four out of the five mining companies evaluated in this study were constituents of the ftse/jse socially responsible investment (sri) index in 2008. drdgold was the only company not to feature in the index. although participation in the index is voluntary, it does, however, show that a company is committed to improving its csr standing. participation in the index is thus strongly recommended. as in the case of investors, consumers and consumer groups across the globe are also becoming more concerned about csr issues. by including local communities into mining activities, mining companies can contribute towards the well-being of the communities by means of training, education and employment. due to their size, mining companies are increasingly expected to make positive contributions to society. from the results of this study, it seems as if csr issues that impact on the economic performance of a company (the foundation of carrolls csr pyramid) are given top priority with those that have a lesser economic impact following thereafter. this results in csr issues such as hiv/aids as well as other health and safety issues being the main focus, whereas issues relating to economic empowerment hardly feature in the reports. despite being emphasised (to the extent of ranking second in issues attended to) in annual and sustainability reports, health issues other than hiv/aids (such as silicosis, tuberculosis and noise-induced hearing loss) and safety issues (such as work-related fatalities) are sorely in need of proper attention. this should not be done merely to reach the deadlines set at the mine health and safety council summit, but should also feature as an expression of these companies commitment to good corporate citizenship. so far not enough has been achieved to reach these deadlines as many rock falls continue to be regularly reported by the media. it is recommended that mining companies take a more balanced view of the various csr categories regardless of the specific categorys impact on profitability. mining companies should specifically increase their efforts (and focus of reporting) on broad based black economic empowerment (bbbee), training and education and work-related fatalities. this might prove costly at first, but might prove profitable once considerable investments have been made in these areas. it will also improve their standing with internal and external stakeholders who value companies meeting their ethical and philanthropic responsibilities.", "keywords": "content analysis, corporate social

healthcare in low- and middle-income countries (lmics) has traditionally involved vertical public health strategies with little emphasis on the delivery of safe and effective surgery and anesthesia. the past 20 years has witnessed greater awareness of the numbers of people who have no access to surgery, the morbidity and mortality of such limited access, and the cost to the individual and society if a solution is not found. global surgery has become a hot topic and the millennium development goals (mdg) and the sustainable development goals (sdg) have underlined the importance of surgery in national health care plans. the harsh metrics reported by the lancet commission has framed the problem in more concrete terms and as of today, over 5 billion people lack access to safe surgery, over 143 million extra surgeries are needed annually to affect the imbalance and more than 15,000 children die each day in sub saharan africa and southeast asia from preventable disease, including the lack of access to safe surgery. horizontal integrated healthcare that includes surgical provision is the new norm, but its introduction is expensive and will need time. the ambition of universal healthcare access for all people (sdg) with a corresponding reduction in child and maternal mortality will be difficult for most governments. altruistic, non-governmental organizations (ngos) are ideally placed to assist this goal but must introduce changes in practice to include onsite and off-site training, broad partnerships with other ngos and academic bodies and greater advocacy with governments to ensure sustainability. ngos should work in concert with local agencies, hospitals and governments to meet local needs. 2021 royal college of surgeons of edinburgh (scottish charity number sc005317)

work in challenging environments and with non-governmental organizations. their sacrifice of time and expertise has significant impact on individuals lives and society. most importantly i would like to thank our friends and colleagues at the childrens hospital 2 and city childrens hospital, ho chi minh city and at muhimbili national hospital, dar es salaam, tanzania, who constantly inspire and lead us with patience and dignity., funding text\\xa02:\\xa0in the wake of the mdg, sdg the lancet commission and others, there has been a sustained and almost urgent drive to meet the aspirations of universal access to safe surgery and anesthesia by 2030. as discussed above, this significant task is hampered by a lack of finance, robust infrastructure, skilled workforce and general confidence in healthcare. 1 ngos are, by and large not hobbled by such constraints and find themselves ideally positioned to assist in the implementation of these aspirations. however, their roles, performance and sustainability need to be re-evaluated if they are to significantly impact on sdgs. in a traditional sense, ngos have mostly functioned, often in the background, as service providers perhaps in general or more specialized surgery but not always with a major emphasis on local training. if we consider that only 12 of the current global surgical workforce work in africa and southeast asia and that an extra 143 million surgical interventions are needed annually, it is easy to conclude that we have a significant manpower problem. 1 , 34 surgical ngos can make a very important service impact but currently not on the scale needed. the key must be in building local capacity while retaining staff where they are most needed. an excellent example of this is the teach-train-accredit model introduced by rcsi with the college of surgeons of east, central and south africa (cosecsa). 35 this collaborative program was introduced in 2008 to provide and improve surgical and anesthetic care in the cosecsa region, in the form of a curriculum relevant to local needs and accreditation. it has grown significantly, has demonstrated staff retention rates of nearly 75 and recently announced funding of 1.2 million to train 112 cleft and reconstructive surgeons in sub-saharan africa. 36 there are many other examples of regional engagement and partnership all with a unifying theme of building local capacity. smaller ngos e.g., operation childlife (ocl), an irish registered charity 37 have the potential to train on a wider capacity. over a period of 14 years ocl has trained nurses, perfusionists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons to open and fully operate a pediatric cardiac (surgery, cardiological intervention and diagnosis) program in ho chi minh city, vietnam. the model used a 36 month fully sponsored training period in ireland with a process of progressive mentorship in childrens hospital 2 in ho chi minh city, vietnam. the same model has been used by ocl to train paediatric airway and oncological surgeons 38 and has been extended to include pediatric neurosurgery and urology (with additional training in bahrain). a vital part of this model is constant and frequent engagement. while covid has curtailed physical site visits, ocl volunteers are available for online consultation, which continues to foster a spirit of co-operation and support. the pandemic has prompted development of a more robust and formal virtual online consultation service. each visit or interaction aims to assist with clinical decision making, surgical and anaesthetic techniques and includes formal teaching programmes. ngos have access to hospital staff and have an excellent opportunity to use each visit as a more structured teaching platform by including formal teaching programs. similar partnerships include surgafrica which is funded by the european horizon 2020 programme, and which aims to improve district (rural) surgical systems and access to safe surgery in

has traditionally involved vertical public health strategies with little emphasis on the delivery of safe and effective surgery and anesthesia. the past 20 years has witnessed greater awareness of the numbers of people who have no access to surgery, the morbidity and mortality of such limited access, and the cost to the individual and society if a solution is not found. global surgery has become a hot topic and the millennium development goals (mdg) and the sustainable development goals (sdg) have underlined the importance of surgery in national health care plans. the harsh metrics reported by the lancet commission has framed the problem in more concrete terms and as of today, over 5 billion people lack access to safe surgery, over 143 million extra surgeries are needed annually to affect the imbalance and more than 15,000 children die each day in sub saharan africa and southeast asia from preventable disease, including the lack of access to safe surgery. horizontal integrated healthcare that includes surgical provision is the new norm, but its introduction is expensive and will need time. the ambition of universal healthcare access for all people (sdg) with a corresponding reduction in child and maternal mortality will be difficult for most governments. altruistic, nongovernmental organizations (ngos) are ideally placed to assist this goal but must introduce changes in practice to include onsite and off-site training, broad partnerships with other ngos and academic bodies and greater advocacy with governments to ensure sustainability. ngos should work in concert with local agencies, hospitals and governments to meet local needs.

are used to analyse the influences of the philanthropy of the wealthy on ngo development. the article proposes not only that the philanthropy of the wealthy provides funding and intellectual support
