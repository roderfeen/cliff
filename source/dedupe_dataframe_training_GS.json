"2016", "abstract": "recently there has been increasing attention in the literature about the role of the corporation with respect to its social responsibility. the shift in approach is reflected in a move from philanthropy to pragmatism as stakeholders have increasing expectations of business to not only spend their corporate social responsibility funds more wisely but to weave social responsibility throughout the fabric of the business. in this new context, what are the implications for leadership what are the qualities of leadership that are required how do we develop leadership with a social lens do we need a new breed of social leaders to shift corporate social responsibility from philanthropy to pragmatism it is these questions that this paper explores. as a starting point, a series of research questions on leadership and corporate social responsibility were developed. these research questions guided the development of the qualitative and quantitative data collection inclusive of a literature review, an online survey and one-on-one focus interviews. over 300 people participated in the research. the research showed that there are clear motivations, enablers and challenges to social leaders and corporate social responsibility. the motivators are personal values and expectations of others. collaboration, self-awareness and working with purpose and vision are all considered critical enablers. in addition the respondents of the survey indicated that systems thinking and diversity are important enablers. challenges include organisation culture, time and energy, resources, remuneration and us and them worldviews. in summary, it was found that social leadership is closely aligned with leadership in general, but there are some specific motivations, enablers and challenges that people found in applying the social lens to their leadership. it was also found there are significant benefits to social leadership and that investing in developing social leadership has merit. while it is clear leadership matters, not just any leadership will be effective in contributing to corporate social responsibility. in a world characterised by complex and multifaceted environmental and social problems with no simple or ready answers, there is need for social leaders-leaders whose focus is on contributing to the common good. for social leadership to thrive to enable the move from philanthropy to pragmatism in corporate social responsibility, there are a number of things that need to be embraced. these include: 1. working collaboratively-working across functions, sectors and disciplines and being willing to abandon an individual agenda for a collective one. 2. letting go of outdated stereotypes of the other and searching for common ground. 3. self-awareness-of their emotions, strengths, the complexity of the system in which they operate. 4. mainstreaming-allowing leaders to lead for the common good as part of their everyday work, not just as an add-on.", "note": null, "notes": "export date: 26 may 2022, correspondence address: duns, s.", "alternate_title3": null, "doi": null, "secondary_title":

database (t3db) was virtually screened for inhibitor activity towards the m-pro enzyme utilizing molecular docking calculations. promising toxins were subsequently characterized using a combination of molecular dynamics (md) simulations and molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (mm-gbsa) binding energy estimations. according to the mm-gbsa binding energies over 200 ns md simulations, three toxins-namely philanthotoxin (t3d2489), azaspiracid (t3d2672), and taziprinone (t3d2378)-demonstrated higher binding affinities against sars-cov-2 m-pro than the co-crystalized inhibitor xf7 with mm-gbsa binding energies of -58.9, -55.9, -50.1, and -43.7 kcal/mol, respectively. the molecular network analyses showed that philanthotoxin provides a ligand lead using the string database, which includes the biochemical top 20 signaling genes ctsb, ctsl, and ctsk. ultimately, pathway enrichment analysis (pea) and reactome mining results revealed that philanthotoxin could prevent severe lung injury in covid-19 patients through the remodeling of interleukins (il-4 and il-13) and the matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). these findings have identified that philanthotoxin-a venom of the

adopted sustainable development goals call for the end of poverty and the equitable provision of healthcare. these goals are often at odds, however: health seeking can lead to catastrophic spending, an outcome for which cancer patients and the poor in resource-limited settings are at particularly high risk. how various health policies affect the additional aims of financial wellbeing and equity is poorly understood. this paper evaluates the health, financial, and equity impacts of governmental and charitable policies for surgical oncology in a resource-limited setting. methods three charitable platforms for surgical oncology delivery in uganda were compared to six governmental policies aimed at improving healthcare access. an extended cost-effectiveness analysis using an agent-based simulation model examined the numbers of lives saved, catastrophic expenditure averted, impoverishment averted, costs, and the distribution of benefits across the wealth spectrum. findings of the nine policies and platforms evaluated, two were able to provide simultaneous health and financial benefits efficiently and equitably: mobile surgical units and governmental policies that simultaneously address surgical scaleup, the cost of surgery, and the cost of transportation. policies that only remove user fees are dominated, as is the commonly employed short-term surgical mission trip. these results are robust to scenario and sensitivity analyses. interpretation the most common platforms for increasing access to surgical care appear unable to provide health and financial risk protection equitably. on the other hand, mobile surgical units, to date an underutilized delivery platform, are able to deliver surgical oncology in a manner that meets sustainable development goals by improving health, financial solvency, and equity. these platforms compare favorably with policies that holistically address surgical delivery and should be considered as countries strengthen health

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has resulted in profound disruptions across the globe, with school closures, social isolation, job loss, illness, and death affecting the lives of children and families in myriad ways. in an editors note in our june 2020 issue,1 our senior editorial team described this journals role in advancing knowledge in child and adolescent mental health during the pandemic and outlined areas we identified as important for science and practice in our field. since then, the journal has published articles on the impacts of the pandemic on child and adolescent mental health and service systems,2-5 which are available in a special collection accessible through the journals website.6 alongside many opinion papers, the pace of publication of empirical research in this area is rapidly expanding, covering important issues such as increased frequency of mental health symptoms among children and adolescents3,5,7-10 and changes in patterns of clinical service use such as emergency department visits.11-14 as the senior editors prepared that editors note, they were acutely aware that the priorities that they identified were broad and generated by only a small group of scientists and clinicians. although this had the advantage of enabling us to get this information out to readers quickly, we decided that a more systematic approach to developing recommendations for research priorities would be of greater long-term value. we were particularly influenced by the efforts of the partnership between the uk academy of medical scientists and a uk mental health research charity (mq: transforming mental health) to detail covid-19related research priorities for mental health science that was published online by holmes et al. in the lancet psychiatry in april 2020.15 consistent with its focus on mental health research across the lifespan, several recommendations highlighted child development and childrens mental health. however, a more detailed assessment of research priorities related to child and adolescent mental health was beyond the scope of that paper. furthermore, the publication of that position paper preceded the death of george floyd at the hands of minneapolis police on may 25, 2020, which re-energized efforts to acknowledge and to address racism and healthcare disparities in the united states and many other countries. to build upon the jaacap editors note1 and the work of holmes et al.,15 we conducted an international survey of professionalspractitioners and researchersworking on child and adolescent development and pediatric mental health to identify concerns about the impact of the pandemic on children, adolescents, and their families, as well as what is helping families navigate these impacts, and the specific research topics that are of greatest importance. 2021 american academy of child adolescent psychiatry", "note": null, "notes": "cited by :5, export date: 26 may 2022, coden: jaape,

seen fully realized in the current manifestation of the trans-global distribution of secondhand garments. in havana however, the clandestina brand brilliantly subverts this process. their products are made up of old t-shirts and garments that originated in north america and europe and were purchased cheaply through government-run cuban stores. these are then re-cut and re-sewn into stylish shapes and silk-screened with graphics that subvert the original messages of the t-shirts. this essay examines the history of secondhand clothing as well as the current impacts of the glut of secondhand goods. it also highlights the fledgling entrepreneurial movement happening in cuba, wherein an independent business can be operated within a trade-sector, in this case: tailoring or dressmaking. methodology examines the sociohistorical development of the modern used clothes distribution economy, and also includes an interview with the clandestina designers. examining in particular how they took a commodity that was completely devalued (dumped on another marketplace), and through their ingenuity and revolutionary vision created a product far more valuable than the original materials. by

through an exploration of a small sample of large retailers in china, both chinese and non-chinese companies. the analysis of csr/sustainability dimensions, as communicated by these large retailers in both the chinese and the english language, shows substantial differences between the chinese and international contexts. interestingly, the largest divergence can be found for international retailers between their chinese and corporate attention for csr (so home versus host settings), most notably in the case of carrefour, and to a lesser extent wal-mart. in the chinese context, there are differences between the chinese and international retailers as well (so domestic versus foreign firms), with the former reporting more on economic dimensions, including philanthropy, and the latter more on product responsibility - contentious labour issues and the environment receive relatively limited attention in both groups in china. the paper concludes with a discussion of the implications

the conduct of enterprises to contribute to sustainable economic development in conjunction with employees, families, the community as well as the broader society to improve the quality of life of all, has become statutory responsibility manipulated by various stakeholders to serve different purposes in the social and business contexts. the concept of corporate social responsibility csr acquired prominence and value for enterprises, especially big business and transnational conglomerates that needed to address legitimacy concerns in the markets in which they operated. animosity between business and society developed as a result of business conduct exploiting resources in the host markets, exploitation of human resources as well as attempts to manipulate governments to gain preferential treatment. the drive to sustain the value extraction within tight time schedules in order to deliver commodities as contracted, from markets in the southern hemisphere to northern hemisphere business, led to labour practices and business conduct which aroused protest and opposition in the exploited markets. international human rights organisations gradually responded by labelling business contravening best practice publically as exploitative and not doing business in good faith. global activism against business exploitation led to the formulation of principles of good conduct, which fed into more formal programmes of responsible business conduct. the early post-industrialisation history in britain has witnessed benevolent actions by well-intended businessmen to alleviate the plight of poor labour, or the poor in the industrialised urban society. these actions were primarily philanthropic, but were later supplemented by entrepreneurial activity to conduct better business. this paper recognises the long history of responsible conduct by business with respect to the needs of the broader society, but it presents a case study of a life assurer in south africa, sanlam. sanlam was not forced by any statute to engage constructively with the broader society, but implemented a policy of corporate social engagement since its formation. sanlams vision and commitment to policyholders best interests, to the education of people whereby they would be empowered to take responsibility for their own lives, was the overarching purpose of the company. it was argued that empowerment of the people is the only method of creating real benefits to the entire south african society (which meant everybody living in south africa), which was the ultimate goal of the life assurer. sanlam implemented corporate social engagement to empower its policyholders, to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the south african economy and thereby to the benefit of all south africans. this paper explores the sanlam corporate social engagement programmes from 1918 to 1980 to illustrate the successful implementation of csr long before csr became a political tool. it is argued that when csr is voluntary and linked directly to stakeholders, such programmes serve to build successful csr and create real benefit to the recipients as well as the broader society. a historical analysis is made of the rationale of sanlam management in implementing programmes to facilitate empowerment of policyholders, the education of needy children as well as bursary schemes for university study. these actions were supplemented by programmes to enable schools to build hostels for school children. sanlam provided credit to people in need of credit, but who would not qualify for credit at ordinary bank institutions, as well as mortgages on agricultural land as a means of empowering its policyholders. sanlam advocated its role as mutual assurer to provide security to its policyholders. therefore sanlam offered access to credit, or a postponement of the payment of policy premiums in case of temporary inability to pay, since thereby the company was seen to practise what it preached: security through life assurance to the people and then through them being secure, greater stability to the south african society and economic progress for everybody living in the country in the long run. sanlam set out to build local ownership of the economy. life assurance thus provided a savings mechanism and simultaneously an ability to grow financial independence, thereby beating white poverty which had taken on crisis proportions during the late 1920s and 1930s. real economic empowerment lay in self-empowerment, facilitated by responsible

null, "year": "2014", "abstract": "corporate social responsibility, broadly understood to be the conduct of enterprises to contribute to sustainable economic development in conjunction with employees, families, the community as well as the broader society to improve the quality of life of all, has become statutory responsibility manipulated by various stakeholders to serve different purposes in the social and business contexts. the concept of corporate social responsibility csr acquired pronzinence and value for enterprises, especially big business and transnational conglomerates that needed to address legitimacy concerns in the markets in which they operated. animosity between business and society developed as a result of business conduct exploiting resources in the host markets, exploitation of human resources as well as attempts to manipulate governments to gain preferential treatment. the drive to sustain the value extraction within tight time schedules in order to deliver commodities as contracted from markets in the southern hemisphere to northern hemisphere business, led to labour practices and business conduct which aroused protest and opposition in the exploited markets. international human rights organisations gradually responded by labelling business contravening best practice publically as exploitative and not doing business in good faith. global activism against business exploitation led to the formulation of principles of good conduct, which fed into more formal programmes of responsible business conduct. the early post-industrialisation history in britain has witnessed benevolent actions by well-intended businessmen to alleviate the plight of poor labour, or the poor in the industrialised urban society. these actions were primarily philanthropic, but were later supplemented by entrepreneurial activity to conduct better business this paper recognises the long history of responsible conduct by business with respect to the needs of the broader society but it presents a case study of a life assurer in south africa, sanlam. sanlam was not forced by any statute to engage constructively with the broader society but implemented a policy of corporate social engagement since its formation. sanlams vision and commitment to policyholders best interests, to the education of people whereby they would be empowered to take responsibility for their own lives, was the overarching purpose of the company it was argued that empowerment of the people is the only method of creating real benefits to the entire south african society (which meant everybody living in south africa), which was the ultimate goal of the life assurer sanlam implemented corporate social engagement to empower as policyholders, to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the south african economy and thereby to the benefit of all south africans. this paper explores the sanhun corporate social engagement programmes from 1918 to 1980 to illustrate the success:fill implementation of csr long before csr became a political tool. iris argued that when csr is voluntary and linked directly to stakeholders, such programmes serve to build successiiil csr and create real benefit to the recipients as well as the broader society. a historical analysis is made of the rationale of san lain management in implementing programmes to facilitate empowerment of policyholders, the education of needy children as well as bursary schemes for university study these actions were supplemented by programmes to enable schools to build hostels for school children. sanlam provided credit to people in need of credit, but who would not (qualify for credit at ordinary bank institutions, as well as mortgages on agricultural land as a means of empowering its policyholders. sanlam n advocated its role as mutual assurer to provide security to its policyholders. therefore sanlam offered access to credit, or a postponement of the payment of policy premiums in case of temporary inability to pay since thereby the company was seen to practise what it preached: security through life assurance to the people and then through them being secure, greater stability to the south african society and economic progress for everybody living in the country in the long run. sanlam set out to build local ownership of the economy. life assurance thus provided a savings mechanism and simultaneously an ability to grow.financial independence, thereby beating white poverty which had taken on crisis proportions during the late 1920s and 1930s. real economic empowerment lay in self:empowerment,,facilitated by responsible corporate social engagement by the sanlam management. the corporate social engagement programmes of salaam before 1980 was directed at its own policyholders, but the profile of that constituency always included non-afrikaners as well. this paper explores the non-statutory real social engagement programmes of sanlam aimed at real empowerment and not politically sanctioned action to serve biased political interests.", "note": null, "notes": "times cited in web of science core collection: 2, total times cited: 2, cited
